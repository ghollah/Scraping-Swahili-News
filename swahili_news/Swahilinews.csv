Merkel's govt to unveil strategy to tackle climate change,['More This Author'],"By AFP

More by this Author

Berlin

Feeling the heat from a vocal climate protest movement, German Chancellor Angela Merkel's government plans Friday to unveil a multi-billion-euro grand plan for tackling global warming.

Days before a UN climate summit in New York, Merkel's team was due to announce details as the top EU economy, once a green energy pioneer, is bound to miss its 2020 carbon reduction targets.

Political parties were still haggling over the details early in the week, but Berlin was likely to pledge some 40 billion euros (USD44 billion) over four years, newspaper Welt am Sonntag reported.

PUBLIC TRANSPORT

Measures proposed by Merkel's CDU party include boosting public transport services, making train travel cheaper and flying more expensive, and raising subsidies for cleaner cars and home heating systems.

Advertisement

A bone of contention remained how to price the emission of climate-killer CO2 into economic activity – either through a carbon tax or the trading of emissions permits, the option favoured by Merkel.

""Climate protection is a challenge for humankind,"" she said in her latest weekly podcast.

""We can see that climate change is already a reality. In the past 50 years, storms, heat waves and floods have also tripled in Germany.

""Germany is an industrialised country. In recent decades we have emitted a great deal of CO2 and thus contributed to global warming.""

BLISTERING SUMMER

At the end of Germany's second blistering summer in a row, as fear of climate change has energised especially young voters, the mainstream parties are struggling to catch up on the hot-button issue.

Merkel's government will announce its plan on the day expected to see the biggest international wave of climate strikes yet by the Fridays for Future movement and the hundreds of civic groups that support it.

""We are heading for a life-destroying crisis and so far nothing has happened,"" said Linus Steinmetz of the student movement launched last year by Swedish teenage activist Greta Thunberg.

""That's why we're raising the pressure – together we're strong.""

EMISSIONS

Export powerhouse Germany accounts for around two percent of the worldwide emissions blamed for heating the Earth's atmosphere, melting ice caps, raising sea levels and intensifying violent weather events.

Merkel, a scientist by profession, was once known as the ""climate chancellor"" as she pushed forward a green energy transition that vastly increased clean renewables such as wind and solar power.

However, many of those gains have been eroded by an increased reliance on dirty coal, in part to offset the phase-out by 2022 of nuclear power that Merkel decided after Japan's 2011 Fukushima disaster.

ELECTRIC CARS

Car-mad Germany has also lagged badly behind in the transport sector, where state-coddled auto giants VW, Daimler and BMW have long focused on gas-guzzling SUVs more than on hybrid or zero-emission electric cars.

While the details of the climate plan remained hazy, Finance Minister Olaf Scholz promised a ""very ambitious"" package.

""I can feel the will of all coalition partners to actually achieve something that does justice to the scope of the challenge,"" he said on ZDF public television.

Speaking separately to Bild am Sonntag newspaper, Scholz suggested that a switch to electric cars could be boosted with ""something like a one-million-charging-station programme"".

Scholz's Social Democrats, junior coalition partners to Merkel's conservatives, have also called for a broad carbon tax, which would raise the cost of goods and services reliant on fossil fuels.

YELLOW VESTS

Merkel's bloc has, however, resisted this, perhaps mindful of how a French plan for a climate levy helped spark the ""yellow vests"" protest movement.

Her party instead advocates extending the trade in right-to-pollute emission certificates to the transport and building sectors.

The climate package presents a delicate balancing act for the two mainstream parties, which have been under fire from both the far-right Alternative for Germany party and the ascendant Greens.

On the one hand, the anti-immigration AfD, which is strongest in the ex-communist east, rails against Merkel's government, wind energy farms and the planned closure of Germany's last coal mines.",https://www.nation.co.ke/image/view/-/5276060/medRes/2445912/-/2tl6b4/-/angela-pic.jpg,[],https://www.nation.co.ke/news/world/Germany-to-unveil-plan-to-tackle-global-warming/1068-5276056-wieror/index.html,2019-09-17 04:41:00
"Uganda, Rwanda committed to Luanda agreement – Officials",['More This Author'],"By IVAN R MUGISHA

KIGALI

Rwanda and Uganda are committed to implementing the agreement signed in August in Luanda to ease tension between them, government officials from both countries said Monday.

Presidents Paul Kagame of Rwanda and Yoweri Museveni of Uganda signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) in Angola’s capital Luanda, witnessed by Presidents Joao Lourenco (Angola) and Felix Tshisekedi (DR Congo).

On Monday, government officials from Rwanda and Uganda were locked for hours in a private meeting in Kigali, as they sought to find ways to cease hostilities that have led to trade and travel restrictions.

FULLY IMPLEMENT DEAL

In an open morning session, Ugandan Minister of Foreign Affairs Sam Kutesa said his country desires to “fully implement” the agreement.

“The MoU underlines the scale of Pan Africanism and is vital to our social economic development. Our two countries have long historic socio-economic and cultural ties and the closure of borders has disrupted communities, separated families and disrupted trade and movement of goods and people,” Mr Kutesa said.

“Uganda is home to millions of people from Rwanda who are recognised as Ugandan citizens by our constitution. The people of our two countries are anxious and need to see progress. Therefore, we should consider the immediate steps to finding solutions.”

RWANDA COMMITTED

Rwanda’s Minister of State for the East African Community, Olivier Nduhungirehe, added that the country is “fully committed to the realisation of the objectives of the MoU and we will not be found wanting.”

“Much as the MoU signing was important it is good faith implementation that is the decisive factor. That is what our citizens expect from us,” he said.

“As neighbours and partners of EAC, we share a common vision of peace, security and economic integration and we are bound by protocols we have signed especially the protocol on peace and security, and the common market protocol which provides free movement of people, goods and services and capital,” Mr Nduhungirehe added.",https://www.nation.co.ke/image/view/-/5276046/medRes/2445831/-/p87tflz/-/ugarwa-pic.jpg,[],https://www.nation.co.ke/news/africa/Uganda-Rwanda-officials-meet-to-end-hostilities/1066-5276044-yy58ofz/index.html,2019-09-17 04:32:00
UK Supreme Court to hear case on parliament's suspension,['More This Author'],"By AFP

London

The Brexit drama switches venues from Brussels to the UK Supreme Court on Tuesday for hearings on Boris Johnson's explosive decision to suspend parliament for over a month.

The British prime minister's first talks Monday with European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker and top EU negotiator Michel Barnier ended with an admonishment from Brussels.

Juncker's office said Johnson was reminded that ""it is the UK's responsibility to come forward with legally operational solutions"" to the existing divorce deal that the British parliament refuses to accept.

""Such proposals have not yet been made.""

GOOD CHANCE

Advertisement

Johnson countered that there was a ""good chance"" of striking a new agreement if there was ""movement"" from Brussels.

""If we can get that done, we're at the races,"" he said.

But Johnson's political hand in the run-up to Britain's October 31 departure could be weakened by 11 judges who will hear the parliamentary suspension challenge on Tuesday.

Court proceeding could last until Thursday and the timing of any ruling is uncertain.

The Supreme Court's entry into the three-and-a-half year saga stems from Johnson's ""do or die"" promise to take Britain out of the EU without any further delay.

SUSPENDED PARLIAMENT

Johnson suspended parliament until October 14 in what his critics cry was a blatant bid to keep his pro-European opponents from trying to get Brexit delayed.

The government counters that parliament is dissolved yearly at the end of every session and that Johnson was simply clearing the way for a new agenda following Theresa May's resignation in July.

The court must now rule on Johnson's motivation – and whether it has the right to make political adjudications at all.

The High Court in England has sided with Johnson while its Scottish counterpart called the suspension ""unlawful"".

London's Queen Mary University law professor Sionaidh Douglas-Scott said the Supreme Court – the highest legal authority in all of Britain – has not faced a case of this kind since the 1600s.

MONUMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

She said the verdict could have monumental consequences not only for Brexit but also how the world's oldest parliamentary democracy functions down the line.

""If parliament is prorogued (suspended) with no remedy available then the balance of power is tipped far too heavily to the executive,"" she told AFP.

Former prime minister David Cameron – the Conservative leader who resigned after losing the Brexit referendum in 2016 – said he also thought Johnson was ""trying to restrict the debate"".

""It looked to me, from the outside, like rather sharp practice of trying to restrict the debate,"" he said.

A defeat for Johnson would leave him open to charges that he has effectively lied to Queen Elizabeth II, who gave the formal order to suspend parliament.

LITTLE CHOICE

Britain's beloved monarch is the formal head of state and has little choice but to trust the prime minister when he asks her to end parliamentary sessions.

Johnson is already skirting the edges of the law by insisting that he would rather be ""dead in a ditch"" than ask his European counterparts to postpone Brexit for a third time.

Parliament has passed a law forcing him to ask the other European leaders for a delay if no compromise emerges from an October 17-18 EU summit in Brussels.

CHAOTIC 'NO-DEAL'

Johnson's hand is helped by widespread fears of what a chaotic ""no-deal"" end to Britain's 46-year involvement in the European project would have on businesses and the public.

The government has been forced to publish documents warning that this outcome could spark civil unrest and shortages of food and medicines.

Small groups of more moderate MPs on both sides of the political divide have reportedly expressed a willingness to back a compromise agreement.

The European Union would also prefer to avoid getting blamed for helping push one of its main members out without any safety arrangements.",https://www.nation.co.ke/image/view/-/5276050/medRes/2445905/-/mw7vb1z/-/brexit-pic.jpg,[],https://www.nation.co.ke/news/world/Brexit-drama-moves-to-UK-Supreme-Court/1068-5276048-cglay0z/index.html,2019-09-17 04:13:00
Cohen murder: Wife issues demands ahead of autopsy,['More This Author'],"By MAUREEN KAKAH

More by this Author

Ms Sarah Wairimu Cohen has made a raft of requests ahead of a post-mortem slated to be conducted today (Tuesday) on murdered tycoon Tob Cohen’s body in the presence of his kin, defence and state lawyers.

Among the items Ms Wairimu has asked for include facilities for post-mortem x-ray, a visit to the site where the body was found, a bone-cutting saw and enough containers for the material to be analysed.

Justice Jessi Lesiit ordered that the body be examined on Tuesday after a letter was presented in court indicating that an independent pathologist, Prof Andrew Kanyi Gachii, who was recommended by the deceased’s family, was unavailable on Monday when postmortem was initially set to be conducted.

The letter was written by lawyer Phillip Murgor who is representing Ms Sarah Wairimu, the deceased’s wife and a suspect in his murder, after the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) and Director of Criminal Investigation (DCI) informed them on Saturday of the scheduled date and time.

RESOURCES

However, the defence requested the court to ensure the family gets a pre-postmortem conference involving the legitimate stakeholders only, a visit to the alleged scene of crime and a visit to the location where the body was allegedly recovered.

The defence also asked court that arrangements be made with regards to facilities for postmortem X-rays, adequate facilities, particularly a bone-cutting saw, and adequate containers for the collection of samples for toxicological analysis.

Prosecution lawyer Nicholas Mutuku and the lawyer representing Cohen’s family, Mr Cliff Ombeta, did not object to the requests.

Justice Lesiit also directed that the suspect be subjected to a mental fitness test before pleading to the murder charges.

“Post-mortem to be done tomorrow, the defence and the family have engaged their doctors. Mental assessment to be taken within seven days,” the judge ruled.

MEDIA GAG

And following complaints from parties in the case about leaking of information to the media regarding investigations into the murder of Cohen, the judge also barred the media from publishing details about the investigations or on any evidence touching on the case.

“The DCI, prosecution, defence and victims to desist from addressing the media on the investigations and evidence alleged to exist in this case,” Justice Lesiit ordered.

Cohen’s Amsterdam-based sister Gabrielle Van Straten together with her husband Mr Roy Van Straten attended the court proceedings.

Team kicks out media in Sh1.7bn AAR scam probe,['More This Author'],"In July, the acting county secretary asked for the media to leave the committee sitting before he could answer any queries regarding the controversial AAR medical cover.

In financial year ending June 30, 2016, the number of employees were 13, 348 with the contract value of Sh346.3 million, the same for 2016/2017 which had 13, 097 employees.

The controversial Sh1.7 billion AAR Kenya City Hall staff medical insurance scheme has reared its ugly head again with the media being ejected from a watchdog committee sitting probing the scandal.

Division emerged among the committee members after journalists were asked to leave the Nairobi County Assembly Public Accounts Committee (PAC) meeting.

Nairobi acting County Secretary Leboo Morintat on Monday called for the media to be kicked out of the meeting.

The committee is grilling more than seven members of the county executive regarding their role in the contentious Sh1.7 billion medical insurance.

CONTRACT

Nairobi County government is on the spot for paying more than Sh652 million in excess of the medical scheme’s contract term of Sh1.07 billion.

Advertisement

According to the Auditor General’s report for the financial year ending June 30, 2018, City Hall made a total payment of Sh1.73 billion to AAR Insurance Kenya Limited although the contract sum was Sh1.07 billion.

“Although the total payment made so far to AAR Insurance Kenya Limited is Sh1, 725, 488, 939, no explanation has been given for paying Sh652, 786, 602 in excess of the contract sum of Sh1, 072, 702, 337,” read in part the report.

In addition, a comparison of the annual contract sum shows unexplained growth in value of the insurance cover even though there was decline in the number of staff by 402 during the year under review.

In financial year ending June 30, 2016, the number of employees were 13, 348 with the contract value of Sh346.3 million, the same for 2016/2017 which had 13, 097 employees.

In the financial year ending June 20, 2018, the contract sum for the medical insurance scheme shot up to Sh1.1 billion although the number of employees had reduced to 12, 695. Currently the county has 12, 499 staff.

FRIVOLOUS

In July, the acting county secretary asked for the media to leave the committee sitting before he could answer any queries regarding the controversial AAR medical cover. The request was also granted.

Most members of the committee, five out of six, protested the request to send the media out. Despite the opposition, the chair of the committee Wilfred Odalo granted Mr Morintat his wish. Only Kilimani MCA Moses Ogeto supported the move.

Minority Whip Peter Imwatok and Karen MCA David Mberia said it was frivolous for the executive to call for exclusion of the media with no justifiable reasons.

“Throwing the media out will paint the county in bad light as this is not the first time this officer has done this. The public will not forgive this committee if this will be the trend,” said Mr Imwatok.

“There is nothing to hide as we are discussing matters of public concern. This is the second time this officer is making the request,” said Mr Mberia.

Sarang’ombe MCA Lawrence Otieno and his Ngei counterpart Redson Otieno agreed with Mr Imwatok.

SITTING FAILED

Mr Otieno said: “The media has to stay because the public wants to know how their money was spent. Why is the member afraid of the media when he appears before us?”

The exclusion of the media from the committee sitting came after intense lobby to have the committee cancel the sitting failed.

The session, which was to start at 10.30am, was suspended for several hours only to start at 1pm.

Interestingly, only ODM-allied members of the committee were present at the meeting. Their Jubilee counterparts who had come for the sitting left.

One of the Jubilee MCAs told the Nation that they had been threatened by their party leadership that they would be de-whipped if they attended the sitting.

“We have been told not to attend the session and those who dare will be de-whipped from committees,” said the MCA who did not want to be identified for fear of victimisation.

The committee has lately been under pressure for unearthing malpractices at the executive and their hard hitting reports with members being accused of colluding with the media to expose Governor Mike Sonko’s administration.

WITNESS

Mr Leboo has been cited by the committee as a ‘malicious’ witness for repeatedly failing to appear before it.

This prompted the committee to invite him and six other officers.

The AAR cover has come under scrutiny since the deal was signed with former Governor Evans Kidero’s administration in 2015.

The firm has been earning between Sh1.06 billion and Sh1.3 billion every year.

The firm’s contract with the county government was to end on June 30, 2017, but Governor Sonko administration extended it by three months to allow time for procurement.

This led to outcry from a section of the MCAs with a case ending in court.",https://www.nation.co.ke/image/view/-/5276042/medRes/2445898/-/dmm630/-/city-pic.jpg,[],https://www.nation.co.ke/counties/nairobi/Team-kicks-out-media-in-Sh1-7bn-AAR-scam-probe/1954174-5276040-rskp4jz/index.html,2019-09-16 20:46:06

BY THE BOOK: Omwa Ombara,['Kariuki Wa Nyamu'],"If your story can change one life, you will have saved the world.

By KARIUKI WA NYAMU

Omwa Ombara, a seasoned journalist, was the first female bureau chief of the Standard Group in East Africa. She taught English and Literature in English, and Catholic Pastoral at Loreto Convent Msongari, Nairobi. She lives as a political asylee in the US and is the author of a memoir, God’s Child On the Run.

What are the three most memorable books you have read so far, and what makes them so?

A Suitable Boy by Vikram Seth stole my heart. It is 1400 pages and brilliantly follows an Indian mother’s pursuit of a husband for her well-educated daughter. The book has helped me appreciate cultural conflict and diversity.

The River Between by Ngugi wa Thiong’o is a masterpiece. “Tell Nyambura I see Jesus.” These words mark the triumph of culture over colonialism. I love its historical perspective capturing Kenya’s colonial period. The rivalry between the two villages, Kameno and Makuyu, the intrigues and the love stories and betrayals surrounding Waiyaki and Nyambura, teaches that unity is the key to survival.

Then there’s the allegory, Animal Farm by George Orwell. The animals rebel against a cruel human farmer called Mr Jones, hoping for change and equality. Instead, dictatorship creeps in headed by a pig called Napoleon. As a human rights activist, this book is always a point of reference. We strive so much for change but when new leadership sets in, the more things change, the more they remain the same.

How many books on average do you read in a year, and do you have a favourite spot where you read them from?

I read about 50 books a year, one every week. My favourite spot is on the bus and at the bus stop or railway station when traveling to and from work.

Which is your most favourite genre of books? Any reason?

I love memoirs. They are true to life and authentic. It takes courage to share your whole soul with the world and I value that.

What is the size of your book collection as of now? Where do you get them from,and what motivates you to?

Wherever I have lived, I keep a library. I have about 1000 books currently. I buy 4 books in a month and also pick up cheap copies that libraries sell at $0.25 (Sh. 25). Books can be expensive, especially for students. I have always dreamt of having a resource centre where writers could come and chill as they read and write. This dream is still valid.

Which are your two most treasured books and why? Would you lend them out?

The Bible, because of its dual role as a literature and faith book serves my interests well. My Memoir, God’s Child On the Run, because it gives me the power to own my story. I do not lend books. People rarely return them. I’d rather buy you a copy.

If you were to become a character from a book, who would you be and why?

Wodu Wakiri the Wag in The Concubine by Elechi Amadi. He creates comic relief in a bizarre atmosphere. We should be able to laugh at our own follies. I do.

If you had the opportunity to meet three authors, dead or alive, who would they be and why?

Prof Wole Soyinka. I am curious as to what drove him to write, The Road and his obsession with life after death.

Dr Stella Nyanzi. Her writings explore powerful political activism using images from the human anatomy. Her writing is antique and monumental and questions the role of aesthetics in literature.

Oprah Winfrey. Her story is an inspiration and her Super Soul Sunday show is warmly educative.

What is that one book you read that was out of your comfort zone?

The Koran. I wanted to read for myself and clarify rumours I had heard about the Muslim faith.

If you were to recommend three books to a 10-year-old, which ones would they be and why?

Land Without Thunder by Grace Ogot, Wendo Tours Nairobi County by Vera Omwocha and Beautiful Nyakio and other Stories by Fredrick Ndung’u. Children need such adventure stories that help them explore so that they can sharpen their creativity and imagination.

Have you ever had a bad commentary about your writing? What did it say and how did you deal with it?

Yes. Criticism is a regular part of a writer’s life especially in journalism. There is a sub-editor who could not stand my work. She said I could not write. I did not have to deal with it because when I got a promotion, she resigned.

What are your thoughts on the reading culture of Kenyans in the face of popular culture?

I have not been in Kenya for about seven years now, so I am not in a position to give an informed opinion on this. Still, I would say that as an oral society, we need to work harder to document our stories. I visit bookshops here in the US and find stories about our culture, animals and people written by tourists who have only visited Kenya for three weeks! Writing our own story empowers us and sets the record straight for generations to come.

E-books versus hard copies, what is your preference and why?

I prefer hard copies. I love the feel of the book, the smell of printing paper and I feel a personal bonding with the author, especially if it is autographed. E-book is great especially where there is Wi-Fi.

What was your last read and how did you find it?

Toni Morrison by Jean E. Bashfield. It features the life of the late acclaimed African American author, Toni Morrison. Despite a challenging childhood, Morrison enjoys her role in introducing African Americans to their own heritage. “We have to know the past so that we can use it for now,” she asserts. That is a goal many readers, including me can reach.

If you weren’t an author and journalist, what would you be?

I’d be a recording artiste. Music is my other love.

What piece of advice would you wish all aspiring authors to keep in mind?",https://www.nation.co.ke/image/view/-/5274956/medRes/2445236/-/pddp0m/-/Main.jpg,[],https://www.nation.co.ke/lifestyle/artculture/BY-THE-BOOK-Omwa-Ombara/1954194-5274948-bj0eqaz/index.html,2019-09-16 07:37:13

Sarah Wairimu to take plea on Sept 26 in Tob Cohen murder,['More This Author'],"By RICHARD MUNGUTI

More by this Author

The High Court has directed that Sarah Wairimu, the estranged wife of murdered Dutch tycoon Tob Cohen, will plead to charges on September 26.

Justice Jessie Lesiit on Monday postponed the plea taking after it emerged that Ms Kamotho was yet to undergo a mental exam.

The court directed that the mental assessment be done within seven days, and that a post-mortem exam on Mr Cohen’s body be done on Tuesday.

Judge Lesiit allowed pathologists for Ms Wairimu and the family of the late Cohen to be present during the examination of the body.

BURIAL

Cohen’s family, represented by lawyers Cliff Ombeta and Dunstan Omari, told the court that immediately post-mortem exam is done, they will seek for the release of the body for burial.

But the judge said the court has nothing to do with the internment of the remains.

The judge also agreed to a plea by defence lawyer Philip Murgor to argue Ms Wairimu’s bail application after taking plea on September 26.

Mr Murgor said the suspect has been in custody since August 28.

She directed that Ms Wairimu remains at the Lang’ata Women Prison for the next 10 days.

MEDIA BARED

During the Monday session, the court also barred the media from publishing details of the investigations into Mr Cohen’s murder.

Judge Lesiit also prohibited Mr Cohen’s family from speaking to media.

The orders were issued after Mr Murgor complained that the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) has been conducting investigations in the media.

ESTATE

""We are learning so many things from the media, released to them by the DCI. The media [have] even reported that Cohen passed on his Sh400 million villa to his sister Gabriele,"" Mr Murgor said.

He argued that Ms Wairimu owns 50 percent of the estate.

""I urge the court to release her on bond to fight for her rights through the civil court,"" the lawyer said.

He said a divorce case between the Mr Cohen and Ms Wairimu is pending and the property dispute will be determined.",https://www.nation.co.ke/image/view/-/5275196/medRes/2445396/-/iw4297/-/sarah-pic.jpg,[],https://www.nation.co.ke/news/Tob-Cohen-murder-Wairimu-detained-for-10-days/1056-5275170-136qectz/index.html,2019-09-16 11:00:00

Inside web of lies that led police to Cohen's body,['More This Author'],"By JOHN KAMAU

More by this Author

Dutch tycoon Tob Cohen’s body was not supposed to be found — not until top forensic experts started to piece together the story and wade through the web of lies, concocted stories, half-truths, and pretence.

The Daily Nation can today exclusively reveal how the detectives managed to unwrap the riddle of the missing tycoon leading to the discovery of his body on Friday afternoon — some 55 days after he was alleged to have flown to Bangkok, Thailand, to seek medical attention.

Mr Cohen’s killers thought they had covered their tracks well, and that they had a perfect alibi.

At his Kitisuru home, the cast-iron manhole cover for the rectangular underground water tank was well sealed with cement — and a heavy water boiler put on top like a blank grave marker.

A garden stone sculpture of a leopard, knocked to the ground, lay nearby on its side.

Some of the trees in the neatly laid compound had been pruned and the dry twigs piled on top of the emptied underground tank to naively hide where the body of the Nairobi-based golf tycoon was supposed to rot in the exclusive Nairobi suburb.

EVIDENCE

One of the suspects in custody has told police that he had been given a contract to build a small house on top of the tank — to perpetually seal the site.

Cohen, 71, had built the fresh water tank, under a giant bamboo plant, to store rain water to irrigate his well-manicured lawns — and for use at his impressive sky-blue and white colour bungalow where he lived with his former secretary-turned wife, Sarah Wairimu — whom police have placed at the scene of crime.

It was also the headquarters of his specialised golf tours company, Tobs Kenya Golf Safaris Limited.

Ever since Cohen vanished on the night of July 19 and 20, his estranged wife had maintained to her inquisitive friends and unrelenting investigators that the one-time chief executive officer of Dutch conglomerate Phillips East Africa had left home on the afternoon of July 20 and flown to Thailand to seek medical treatment.

“It was a story she had made up,” says Mr Patrick Kariuki Muiruri — the last person who played a four-ball golf match with Cohen at the Vet Lab golf course in Kabete on July 15.

Mr Muiruri, a former Gatundu North MP, had been Cohen’s friend for the last 30 years.

Evidence now with the police indicates that on the morning of July 19 — and on the day the water tank was emptied, Ms Wairimu placed a call to Peter Njoroge Karanja — the estranged husband of Gilgil MP Martha Wangari.

PHONE TRACKING

Both Mr Karanja and Ms Wairimu were going through divorce proceedings over domestic violence at the High Court in Nairobi. They were also alleged to be lovers.

Mr Karanja, who was then in Gilgil town, told police that he drove his Subaru, registration number KCF 356T, for the two-hour drive after he was summoned by Ms Wairimu.

For what? “Business,” he told detectives.

By using the phone tracking technology, the two forensic experts assigned to the case found that Mr Karanja then called and picked another man in Naivasha and the two drove to Nairobi together.

Police are now hunting for this suspect who is on the run.

At around 10am, after a series of phone calls to Ms Wairimu and which were easily tracked, the three converged at a well-known restaurant in Westlands for a breakfast meeting.

They were captured on CCTV. The bill was paid by Ms Wairimu who left in a hurry.

Later on, the two men had a meeting with the daughter of a late Cabinet minister from Mt Kenya region and they ate lunch together at another popular restaurant.

It was paid by the woman (name withheld), who is also being sought for interrogation.

ASSAULT CHARGES

At about 2.30pm, and after meeting the prominent politician’s daughter, Mr Karanja called Ms Wairimu, and he is captured by road cameras driving towards Naivasha through Waiyaki Way.

That morning, July 19, in a day of drama, a frightened Tob Cohen had gone to Parklands Police Station to follow up on the investigation into assault charges he was pressing against Ms Wairimu.

With the arrival of police, Ms Wairimu is alleged to have locked herself in the bedroom and called officers from the nearby Spring Valley Police Station to rescue her.

“She told them her home had been raided by gangsters,” an informant told Daily Nation.

By the time the Spring Valley police arrived — their counterparts from Parklands had left and with instructions from their boss: both Cohen and Ms Wairimu should be taken to court that coming Monday, July 22, since each had a P3 form — a police chit that acts as evidence that a violent act occurred and is admissible in court as evidence.

A few days earlier, Cohen had also written to the Inspector General of Police and to the Director of Public Prosecutions alleging that police officers from Parklands Police Station had failed to arrest Ms Wairimu, but instead wanted to press charges against him.

“ … Aimed not only at soiling his reputation but also having him deported from Kenya so that his properties become free and available to Sarah Wairimu Kamotho and her accomplices,” a letter from Cohen’s lawyer, Mr Danstan Omari, read.

SARAH IN DANGER

The story had been picked by various news outlets and Ms Wairimu had sent the links to Mr Karanja on the morning of July 19. Why? Nobody knows.

Mr Karanja’s version of the story is that after the morning meeting with Ms Wairimu and on his way back to Naivasha and near Limuru town, he was asked to drive back to Mr Cohen’s home since Wairimu’s life was in danger.

Mr Karanja told detectives that he reached Cohen’s home at 4pm and they found a wealthy former Nairobi county government official — who had driven in a Lexus. In the compound were four policemen who had come to arrest Cohen.

After the Spring Valley police officers left on the afternoon of July 19, and without arresting Cohen — detectives were told that he was “very angry, annoyed and disturbed.”

He entered his Mercedes car, registration number KAD 858S, and drove to Muthaiga Golf Club, where he was a member — and started drinking.

Mr Karanja told detectives that after Cohen left, he drove out with his friend and he headed back to Naivasha where he dropped off his friend at a hotel.

SKETCHY DETAIL

He then drove to another Naivasha restaurant, but before he settled down, he got a call from Ms Wairimu. The time was now 8pm.

“He was asked to return to Nairobi urgently,” a detective familiar with the interrogation says.

Alone, Mr Karanja reached Nairobi at around 10.30pm. But rather than drive to Cohen’s home — he told police that he drove to Parklands Sports Club, took a computer bag and walked outside to look for a taxi. Why? Nobody knows.

The man, now in police custody, told detectives that upon reaching Cohen’s house at about 11.15pm — the gate was opened by an “unknown man”.

He told police that he entered the house through the kitchen door and sat in the TV room, took tea with Ms Wairimu and had “a 30-minute business discussion”.

It was now midnight and he asked to leave. But he had no car.

Detectives were intrigued by this story: why would a man leave Naivasha and drive 100 kilometres to Nairobi at midnight for a 30-minute talk with somebody’s wife? Why did he leave his car at Parklands Sports Club?

By this time, Cohen was at the Muthaiga Golf Club, drinking and worrying. He had spoken to Mr Muiruri at about 10pm who advised him to keep safe.

INCONSISTENCIES

But inside Muthaiga Golf Club was Ms Wairimu’s best friend — a well-known socialite who kept watch on Cohen’s movements.

“This woman kept in touch with Ms Wairimu that night and had called her several times from Muthaiga,” says a detective familiar with the case.

The woman, who comes from a prominent Kiambu family, is also being sought.

While Mr Karanja had initially told police that he walked out of Cohen’s compound at midnight, took a matatu to city centre and a boda-boda to K1 bar in Parklands — his phone data indicated that he spent the night at Cohen’s home until the morning of July 20.

Asked about these inconsistencies, Mr Karanja, in his statement to the police, said he left his two phones and the laptop bag with Ms Wairimu but forgot to switch them off.

“That story is not adding up,” a detective told Daily Nation. “Phone data indicates that all night — and the early morning, Mr Karanja’s phone was in contact with other people — who are also being sought.”

At K1, Mr Karanja had told police, he took Southern Comfort until 4.30am when he walked to the nearby Parklands Sports Club and slept in his car till morning. Police have not found any CCTV footage to back this claim.

STAFF COACHED

Mr Karanja insisted to the police that after washing his face at Parklands, he left his car and took a matatu to Cohen’s place — to ostensibly pick his laptop bag and two phones.

That morning, Ms Wairimu sent Mr Karanja some Sh10,000 — and forensic data indicates that it was sent while the two were together in the house.

He further claims to have taken a matatu to Parklands, picked his vehicle and left for Gilgil.

In one of the WhatsApp communication on the evening of July 20 — and now with the police — Ms Wairimu asks Mr Karanja: “How is your hand now, is it improving?”

Mr Karanja replied: “It is improving.” Cohen’s workers had also told police stories that did not add up.

While the two had claimed that they saw Cohen leaving the compound on the afternoon of July 20, they changed their story when police confronted them with forensic data on their phone locations at 2pm when they alleged to have been at the compound.

One of the workers, initially fired by Cohen, had been summoned from Kayole and arrived at Cohen’s house at around 3pm — while the other never worked during weekends.

They told police they had been “coached” on what to say — and started spilling the beans leading to the arrest of Ms Wairimu.

This also followed a detailed forensic analysis report written by detectives after analysing data on various people in touch with Ms Wairimu on the day Cohen disappeared.

BODY RETRIEVED

But detectives had run into a major hindrance. After interrogating various people, they had not found Cohen’s body and Ms Wairimu had refused to talk.

The defence had got an order that Ms Wairimu, while under arrest, should not be questioned.

She also refused to give her phone’s pin number and screen pattern — thus denying forensic experts a chance to analyse her data.

On August 3, Mr Karanja was advised by Ms Wairimu to switch off his two phones — and “buy mulika mwizi” since detectives were on his trail.

The “mulika mwizi” referred to a cheap phone and this message from Ms Wairimu was retrieved from Mr Karanja’s phone by the forensic team.

As Ms Wairimu is taken to court to plead to murder charges, police will this morning be seeking more time to hold Mr Karanja — the man who spilled the beans on where Cohen’s body was dumped.

Police sources indicate that on Friday morning, the police had prepared charges against Mr Karanja, and just as he was about to be taken to court he asked to reveal something: the whereabouts of Cohen’s body, which was to mark the end of a lengthy search.

COHEN GOES MISSING

Ever since he filed for divorce — and filed assault complaints against his wife — Cohen had expressed his fear to his only sister, Gabrielle Van Straten, and to Mr Muiruri.

“The two had an agreement: every day, without fail, Tob Cohen would call his sister twice to just say he was alive,” says Mr Muiruri.

When Cohen did not call on the morning of July 20, Ms Van Straten panicked and reported the matter to Dutch police that her brother could be in danger.

But by the time she was reporting that her brother was in danger, Ms Wairimu had a day earlier sent a letter to the Dutch Embassy in Nairobi dated July 18, 2019 seeking “help” and saying that Tob has “depression and a mental condition he won’t address for personal reasons”. She wanted them to intervene.

Interestingly, on July 22, Ms Wairimu had reported Cohen as missing at Kilimani Police Station where the matter was booked in the occurrence book.

She had also left the homestead and was staying in hotels.

It was not until July 25, after the Nairobi embassy had received a note from Amsterdam, that they invited Ms Wairimu seeking to know the whereabouts of her husband — and about her letter.

“He said he was going to Thailand,” Ms Wairimu is alleged to have told the two Dutch embassy officials.

MARRIAGE

Thereafter, she left and the two Dutch officials went to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations and raised the matter.

“They (Embassy officials) never helped me,” Ms Wairimu had told this writer before she was arrested and charged with murder. At Kiambu Road, Directorate of Criminal Investigations boss George Kinoti assembled a team of four detectives from both the homicide and forensic departments to help unravel the puzzle of the missing Dutch tycoon.

“It was a very complex case,” says Mr Kinoti. Cohen’s two workers had separately told the police that Cohen left home on the afternoon of July 20 wearing blue jeans and with his briefcase.

They claimed that he was picked up at the gate by a white car. By the time they were being interrogated by police, Ms Wairimu was away in Nyeri — and she repeated the same story.

“She was very composed,” a detective handling the case told the Daily Nation. Cohen married Ms Wairimu on May 30, 2007 after the death of his wife.

But later, according to divorce papers filed in court, the marriage turned rocky, abusive and abrasive.",https://www.nation.co.ke/image/view/-/5274680/medRes/2445063/-/rcukhgz/-/COHPIC.jpg,[],https://www.nation.co.ke/news/How-police-unravelled-Tob-Cohen-murder-/1056-5274674-t9mr6o/index.html,2019-09-16 05:30:00
Top Coast leaders avoid William Ruto’s functions,['More This Author'],"By MOHAMED AHMED

Top leaders from the Coast are conspicuously missing during Deputy President William Ruto’s five-day visit to the region.

Unlike earlier visits when the DP would be accompanied by more than 20 Coast MPs as he criss-crossed the region to launch development projects, this time around only a handful of the legislators attended his functions.

Dr Ruto was seen to have made inroads in the region as he enjoyed support of several politicians, including tens of Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) legislators led by Coast Parliamentary Group chairman Suleiman Dori.

In his earlier tours, the legislators would take turns to declare their support for Dr Ruto’s presidency bid ahead of 2022 as they warmed up to him. Matters seemed to have changed on his current visit.

On Saturday, Dr Ruto’s ally, Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya, did not participate in the DP’s tour of the county.

Only three legislators — Lunga Lunga’s Khatib Mwashetani, Malindi’s Aisha Jumwa and Lamu East’s Sharif Athman — were present.

INVITATION

People close to Mr Mvurya, who did not want to be identified in this story, told the Nation that the governor failed to show up because he had not been involved in inviting the DP, and therefore felt left out.

“It is all about politics. And we are aware that the Deputy President was invited by Lunga Lunga MP Khatib Mwashetani and this might have angered the governor. The governor has endorsed his deputy Fatuma Achani, and by virtue of attending the functions could have been seen as endorsing Mr Mwashetani,” said the source.

The Nation also learnt that Msambweni MP Suleiman Dori has been missing because he has been sick for a while now.

However, on Friday, the second day of his five-day tour during which Dr Ruto visited Kilifi, the Nation learnt that the brigade of MPs was also missing, with only seven of them present.

The MPs who attended the Kilifi function were Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa, Said Haribae (Galole), Khatib Mwashetani (Lunga Lunga), nominated Senator Christine Zawadi, Ali Wario (Bura), Rehema Hassan (Tana River), Shariff Athman (Lamu East), Badi Twalib (Jomvu) and Kaloleni MP Paul Katana.

ODM SANCTIONS

On Thursday when he started his tour in Tana River, only one MP from the region, Mr Ali Wario (Bura) attended.

Others who accompanied him in Tana River were Igembe South’s John Paul Mwirigi and Adan Ali of Mandera East.

On both occasions, the top county leaders, including Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi and Tana River’s Dhado Godhana, were also no show.

On Sunday, Dr Ruto visited Taita-Taveta County where the county boss, Mr Granton Samboja, also failed to show up.

Mr Samboja was conspicuously absent at Bughuta, where the DP helped to raise funds for over 40 local churches in Kasigau Ward.

Area MPs Jones Mlolwa (Voi), Danson Mwashako (Wundanyi), Lydia Haika (Woman Rep) and a number of MCAs attended the event.

Also present were Mr Mwashetani and Benjamin Tayari of Kinango from Kwale County.

2022 STRATEGY

Prof Hassan Mwakimako, a Coast-based political analyst, said the absence, especially of ODM MPs, was as a result of the problems Mr Dori and Ms Jumwa faced with their party.

“We saw the MPs being summoned and actions threatened against them. This move by ODM made others to feel afraid of accompanying the DP, but his (Ruto) absence also saw him lose the base had created for himself,” said Prof Mwakimako.

He added that Dr Ruto’s break of his tour of the region could have been deliberate as he reads the region’s political mood, which is currently not active at all.",https://www.nation.co.ke/image/view/-/5274690/medRes/2445105/-/1l1h8wz/-/allpic.jpg,[],https://www.nation.co.ke/news/politics/Top-Coast-leaders-avoid-William-Ruto-functions/1064-5274688-excvh3z/index.html,2019-09-16 05:30:00

“I have finally received my KCSE certificate indicating my correct three names. Early this month, Knec had issued me with the certificate but it did not have my surname. I requested for the inclusion of the name and I got it today,” she told Nation on phone.

However, Audrey is bothered with the gender marker allocated by the exam council.

Justices Philip Waki, Gatembu Kairu and Otieno Odek who ruled on her case ordered the Kenya Examinations Council to remove gender markings on her certificates.

“I intend to write to Knec requiring them to remove the marking (1). I do not know what it represents and the law was clear that it should not have any gender markings,” she said.

Audrey, formally known as Andrew Ithibu Mbugua, was born and raised as a male. As Andrew, he attended Kiambu High, a boys’ school, where he sat his KCSE in 2001 and scored a mean grade of A- (minus).

GENDER

Like other certificates, Ms Mbugua's was inscribed with the mark, M, signifying the male gender.

In January 2012, by gazette notice Ms Mbugua published by a deed poll, she renounced the name Andrew and assumed ‘Audrey Ithibu Mbugua’.

She then wrote to Knec requesting to effect the changes in her certificate. The council at first appeared to agree but later dismissed her request, forcing Ms Mbugua to move to court.",https://www.nation.co.ke/image/view/-/5275932/medRes/2445863/-/3c5etez/-/dn+court+Audrey+2805b.JPG.jpg,[],https://www.nation.co.ke/news/Transgender-Audrey-Mbugua-gets-updated-KCSE-certificate/1056-5275930-23i23r/index.html,2019-09-16 18:07:11
Kenya steps up vote hunt for UN Security Council seat,['More This Author'],"By AGGREY MUTAMBO

More by this Author

Kenya is on Monday launching its bid for a non-permanent seat at the United Nations Security Council, banking on its diplomats across the globe to do the promotions, amid tighter budgetary cuts.

Emerging from victory at the African Union last month, Kenya says that in fronting the campaign comprising diplomats and senior government officials, it would be killing two birds with one stone.

Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary Monica Juma called it a “well-crafted strategy” to reach out to partners across the globe, targeting some 129 votes out of the 193 member states of the United Nations with voting rights.

“The costs, so far, have been very minimal and we are using existing structures. The instructions to every head of mission is that they campaign at every opportunity they engage in,” she told reporters during the quarterly press briefing in Nairobi on Friday.

“We will rope in other government officials so that, as they travel for other businesses, they promote our candidature. You are not going to see any choppers flying around. It is not that kind of campaigning,” she said, using the imagery of flamboyant political campaigns seen in Kenya at election times, but actually referring to the expensive trips abroad.

AUSTERITY

The move to opt for frugal campaigns may be part of lessons learnt in 2017 when an expensive campaign for the chairperson of the African Union Commission failed to deliver victory to Kenya.

Some estimates indicate that Kenya spent about Sh400 million.

The National Treasury has also restricted expenditure on travel, entertainment and publicity, which cost the government some Sh30 billion in 2018.

Acting National Treasury Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani argued that the cut-down on expenditure was meant to reduce budget deficits, allowing the government to spend cash on more useful development programmes.

Specifically, government officials were told last week they will be ineligible for quarter per diem if their foreign trips were sponsored by third parties.

AFRICA'S GROWTH

In 2018, they spent Sh15.5 billion on travel. And while it isn’t necessarily extravagance, the National Treasury thinks they can save this cash.

In the meantime, Kenya will today launch the bid in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, seeking to win a seat it hopes will elevate the image of Nairobi as well as the Horn of Africa.

Under the theme “Peace and security for sustainable development”, Dr Juma said Kenya’s pledge to Africa is to push for the UN to work more through regional bodies.

Though seeking only to be a non-permanent member for 2021-2022, Kenya says it could use the position to influence policies favourable to the region.

Often, non-permanent members do not decide on substantive votes such as sanctioning a country, but the rotational presidency of the Council gives opportunity for influencing agenda.",https://www.nation.co.ke/image/view/-/5274550/medRes/2444997/-/3vss4xz/-/unpic.jpg,[],https://www.nation.co.ke/news/Kenya-steps-up-vote-hunt-for-UN-Security-Council-seat/1056-5274512-sv6t0r/index.html,2019-09-16 05:30:00
Mwinzi citizenship issue irks Kenyans in diaspora,['More This Author'],"By AGGREY MUTAMBO

More by this Author

The National Assembly’s demand that Ms Mwende Mwinzi renounce her US citizenship to get an ambassadorial post has incensed Kenyans in the diaspora, who claim they are being locked out from serving the country.

The issue has brought to the fore the question of dual citizenship, and how it is a double-edged knife.

The nominated ambassador to South Korea, who holds both American and Kenyan citizenships by birth, now faces the choice between taking the job and retaining her dual nationality.

The Nation has learnt that Seoul already granted her approval to report to her diplomatic duty station.

On August 6, South Korea granted her an agrément, a document which, in diplomatic terms, refers to the approval by the receiving state of a diplomat from the appointing state to live and in the country.

This means that Ms Mwinzi is now only required to apply for a visa to South Korea, after which she can start working after presenting her credentials.

MPs DEBATE

But the National Assembly’s demand that she renounce her US citizenship is the new and last remaining hurdle.

Last week, Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary Monica Juma pledged to abide by the law in dealing with the issue, but steered clear of whether Ms Mwinzi, who has been part of the 18 recent envoys taking up training for new postings, will report for duty after all.

“We are in the administrative process and nobody has taken up their position, and so we have not offended any decision of Parliament and we do not intend to do so,” she told journalists at a quarterly press briefing in Nairobi.

“This nominee was vetted and approved by Parliament. And Parliament then had a caveat on the taking up of the position. So there is an approval process after meeting all the qualifications that had been tested for, and Parliament felt that she needed to renounce the citizenship of the USA,” Ms Juma said.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE

With uncertainty surrounding her appointment, the Kenya Diaspora Alliance (KDA), which represents a grouping of associations of Kenyans living abroad, said the National Assembly was engaging in an illegality by forcing her to renounce a citizenship she did not choose.

“The ideal should have been for Parliament to seek an advisory opinion on the matter, or direct the Attorney-General to do so from the Supreme Court.

""The legislation they are relying on is itself ultra vires (beyond powers) and unconstitutional, therefore offending,” Dr Shem Ochuodho, the KDA Global Chairperson told the Nation.

“We urge the honourable members of Parliament to seize the opportunity to make these ‘forgotten Kenyans’ too to start feeling they belong.""

The lobby argued that Kenyans in the diaspora already sent in more money than Kenya’s annual foreign direct investment, making them the highest foreign exchange earners for the country.

CONSTITUTION

Mr George Mucee, the practice leader at migration consultancy firm Fragomen-Kenya, said the Constitution would not bar her from serving as an ambassador, especially since she is legally a citizen by birth, both in Kenya and the US.

“Ambassadors are not state officers. So strictly speaking, she is not barred by the law,” he said.

“But, it is also a tricky affair and exposes the challenges we face in understanding the rights of Kenyans holding dual nationality.”

For Ms Mwinzi, the question has been whether being ambassador could put her in conflict of loyalty. MPs cited the Leadership and Integrity Act, which is not a citizenship law.

The philanthropist famed for her Twana Twitu Children’s orphanage was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, of Kenyan parents.

Traditionally, citizenship by birth cannot be revoked, but can be renounced through a lengthy procedure.

DUTY

But with her nomination as envoy, she seems to be meeting legal hurdles that escaped her before.

In 2017, she unsuccessfully ran for the Mwingi West parliamentary seat. As MPs are also state officers, the question of her dual nationality would have arisen had she won.

During her vetting, Ms Mwende, 48, argued that dual nationality does not affect ambassadors, even though they may be considered State officers.

She also defended her loyalty to Kenya. “From my adulthood, everything about my life has been Kenya-bound,” she said.

“Every envoy is first a national, a defender … so your first mandate and only mandate is to serve the country. Every person will look at the ambassador and realise that they are the first port of call when the president calls on them for local intelligence.”

However, the procedure for renouncing US nationality is longer than imagined.

PROCESS

According to the US Immigration and Nationality Act, one has to appear before their embassy in person and sign an oath of renunciation.

Once approved, one has to forego every other privilege, including right to live in the US, and may be required to get a visa.

Also, one cannot renounce nationality of their children because citizenship is granted personally. Once accepted, it cannot be reversed, except by a court order.",https://www.nation.co.ke/image/view/-/5274698/medRes/2445075/-/2ecm4y/-/MWIPIC.jpg,[],https://www.nation.co.ke/news/Mwinzi-citizenship-issue-irks-Kenyans-in-diaspora/1056-5274696-24l9v0z/index.html,2019-09-16 05:30:00
TSC races to hear disciplinary cases facing teachers,['More This Author'],"By OUMA WANZALA

More by this Author

The Teachers Service Commission (TSC) has dispatched its commissioners to six regions across the country for hearing of disciplinary cases against teachers as it races against time to conclude pending cases before the end of the year.

TSC received 1,000 cases of indiscipline among teachers this year with 600 being registered across the 47 counties while 400 cases were registered at the headquarters.

SEX

Majority of the cases relate to teachers having sex with their students both in primary and secondary schools.

The six commissioners and secretariat staff will hear 51 cases of teachers engaging in sex with learners and of corporal punishment.

The schedule sent to county TSC directors, which the Nation saw, indicates hearing will start today and end on Friday.

Advertisement

TSC regulations require cases to be heard within three months. The commission has so far handled 750 cases with 250 still pending.

“The regions to be covered are Coast, Eastern, Nyanza, Western, Rift Valley and Central,” reads the communication.

SIX MONTHS

On average, most cases are being determined within two to three months after decentralisation in handling of the cases.

Previously cases would take six months to even one year but now the Commission has committed to determine cases within six months as per service charter.

Cases of teachers having sex with their students in the country with TSC indicating 1,228 teachers have been sacked in the last seven years because of having sex with learners present a worrying scenario.

Some 1,077 teachers in secondary and primary schools were kicked out between 2010 and 2017, while another 151 were dismissed between last year and this year, according to TSC.

According to TSC chief executive officer Nancy Macharia many more cases go unreported because some cultures engender early marriages, while ignorant parents accept hush money from teachers or other school workers.

A report on teenage pregnancies before parliament this year showed that Kakamega County had the highest number of culprits, at 88.

PREGNANCIES

It was followed by Kisii with 61, Homa Bay (60), Kitui (53), Bungoma (47) and Siaya (46). Others are Wajir (1), West Pokot (3), Tana River (4), Nairobi (3), Mandera (1) and Mombasa (4).

However, Mrs Macharia said teachers were responsible for only two percent of pregnancies among learners, adding that local communities were more notorious for preying on schoolgirls.

The sexual harassment report is supported by another study by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco), which raised a red flag about sexual harassment of learners aged 13 to 17 by teachers in 2016.",https://www.nation.co.ke/image/view/-/5274702/medRes/2445078/-/ql10vaz/-/tscpic.jpg,[],https://www.nation.co.ke/news/education/TSC-to-hear-disciplinary-cases-facing-teachers/2643604-5274700-59qb5sz/index.html,2019-09-15 20:55:38
Eight killed after Kenyan bus collides with truck in Uganda,['Asuman Musobya'],"By ASUMAN MUSOBYA

At least eight people were on Sunday killed in a road accident at Nakawa, Busowa Town Council in Uganda's Bugiri District on the Jinja-Tororo highway.

Mr Besweri Kawanguzi, an eyewitness, said the accident that occurred at around 5.30am, involved a bus belonging to Modern Coast that was travelling from Kenya and a truck registration number ZE 2344 from Kampala.

Mr Kawanguzi, who was on his way to the garden at the time of the accident, added that the truck driver lost control of the vehicle and veered to the right-hand side of the road before colliding with the oncoming bus.

Police immediately arrived at the scene and took the bodies to Bugiri Hospital mortuary.

The officer-in-charge of traffic at Bugiri Police Station Hopkins Twesiga, said three people died on the spot, while five others succumbed to their injuries on their way to Bugiri Hospital.

Mr Twesiga added that the survivors were taken to different hospitals including Bugiri, Iganga and Fast Line Medical Centre in Bugiri.

Mr Twesiga said the truck driver and his conductor died on the spot.

World's best teacher Peter Tabichi to address UN assembly,['More This Author'],"By FRANCIS MUREITHI

More by this Author

The world's best teacher, Peter Tabichi, will set a record yet again as the first such professional in Kenya to address the 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.

Brother Tabichi is a member of the St Franciscan Friars, a religious order founded by St Francis of Assisi in the 13th century.

He teaches science at Keriko Mixed Day Secondary School at Pwani village in Njoro, Nakuru County.

In March, the teacher won the 2019 Global Teacher Prize that came with a $1 million reward..

REMARKS

Brother Tabichi will recite the popular St Francis prayer before the start of the general assembly, according to Brother Tony Donald from Ireland.

“This is a big honour for St Franciscan brothers. It shows that the UN recognises our order as it plays a key role in the development of humanity,"" he said.

The teacher is also expected to give brief remarks on how he made it to the top in the teaching profession.

Barely a month after being crowned the best teacher in the world, brother Tabichi was appointed champion for children in conflicts and crisis by a global body, Varky Foundation.

He now champions the cause of the 75 million children worldwide whose education is disrupted by conflicts and natural disasters.

REACTIONS

Brother Donald further noted that this is an honour for all teachers in Kenya.

“Brother Tabichi is an ambassador of Kenya and the Catholic Church. This emphasises St Franciscan Friar's selfless commitment and mission to care for the earth and peace building,” he said.

He spoke at the the Molo Novitiate on Saturday, when he received six new members - men from Kenya and Uganda.

Two brothers took their first vows while seven others renewed theirs in a colourful ceremony that guests from Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania attended.

Father Eladius Tairo from Mbarara Archdiocese in Uganda said the honour bestowed on Brother Tabichi is a big lesson to the world about the role of St Franciscan brothers.

“Joining the vocation is not in vain. Through St Franciscan brothers the world will know the prayer of St Francis of Assisi and hopefully bring more joy and peace in the troubled spots of the world,” said Fr Tairo.

The assembly starts its sessions on September 17 and top on the agenda are climate change, universal health coverage and the politics of sustainable development.",https://www.nation.co.ke/image/view/-/5273950/medRes/2444683/-/i0a3jo/-/Tabichi.jpg,[],https://www.nation.co.ke/news/Another-golden-moment-teacher-Peter-Tabichi/1056-5273894-wby6c7/index.html,2019-09-15 09:41:58

"Keep politics out of churches, Nairobi MCAs tell leaders",['More This Author'],"By COLLINS OMULO

More by this Author

Nairobi Jubilee MCAs have called on Kieleweke and Tanga Tanga groups to stop fighting each other in churches.

Led by Majority Leader Abdi Guyo, the ward representatives blamed the leaders for disrespecting the altar.

This follows the chaos that happened in Murang’a last week when nominated MP Maina Kamanda clashed with Kiharu lawmaker Ndindi Nyoro.

POLITICAL WARS

On Sunday, Laikipia Woman Representative Catherine Waruguru was also turned away from a church in Nanyuki where Mr Kamanda had been earlier.

Mr Guyo asked the politicians to use other forums to advance their agenda but not churches. He asked them to follow the examples set out by temples and mosques where such political fights have never been witnessed.

“Fights and backstabbing of politicians in churches is uncalled for and should not be entertained. Places of worship should be respected and politicians should stop using churches as grounds for attacking each another,” said Mr Guyo during a fundraiser at Macedonia PCEA Church in Kayole, Nairobi, on Sunday.

The MCAs –John Kamau (Komarock), Benson Mwangi (Mowlem) and Jeremiah Themendu (Kayole Central) urged leaders from the two wings to put aside their political differences and focus on delivering on pledges made to their constituents.

DEVELOPMENT

The majority leader reminded the elected leaders that Kenyans will judge them in the ballot come 2022 not according to who shouted loudest in churches, but based on the development they made to their people.

“For now let us keep off campaigns and focus on development. Let us give the President Uhuru Kenyatta time to achieve his agenda. When 2022 comes, Jubilee party shall decide who will take over,” he said.

Mr Guyo also appealed to those opposed to the Handshake between President Kenyatta and Opposition leader Raila Odinga to embrace the pact, saying it has brought peace in the country.",https://www.nation.co.ke/image/view/-/5276002/medRes/2445905/-/7mjx1nz/-/GUYO.jpg,[],https://www.nation.co.ke/news/politics/Nairobi-MCAs-tell-politicians-keep-politics-out-of-churches/1064-5275998-r0grxs/index.html,2019-09-16 18:42:52

A section of opposition leaders has defended Interior Principal Secretary Karanja Kibicho against accusations that he is plotting for the downfall of Deputy President William Ruto.

Led by Makadara MP George Aladwa, the leaders asked their Jubilee counterparts to stop undermining the PS.

Mr Aladwa claimed the allegations against the PS can only distract the public from political mischief that the leaders allied to Tanga Tanga wing of Jubilee party are engaged in.

DIVISION

The lawmaker said that some leaders claimed that Dr Kibicho had threatened them with dire consequences should they continue backing Dr Ruto.

""We ask leaders to stop undermining Dr Kibicho for implementing government policies,"" said Mr Aladwa on Sunday.

He said that leaders were opposed to the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI).

""The leaders are used to the politics of name calling, ethnicity, division and hatred which the Handshake and BBI are addressing,"" he said.

Mr Aladwa said that as Interior PS Mr Kibicho is supposed to oversee the implementation of government policies.

""It is unfortunate that MPs such as Ndindi Nyoro (Kiharu) can go to a church and disrupt the service and when called upon to account for their actions, they point fingers at the PS and Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i.

Nominated MP Maina Kamanda has said that Mt Kenya region will not be forced to back any political leader in 2022. The legislator said that the region did not owe anybody and debt.

In a thinly veiled attack on Deputy President William Ruto, Mr Kamanda criticised politicians using 'force' to sway voters, saying ""no one will use threats to get votes"".

""We will not be forced to give you votes even at gun point, our leader President Uhuru Kenyatta, will give us direction when the time comes,"" Mr Kamanda said at St Paul's African Independent Pentecostal Church of Africa in Nanyuki, Laikipia County on Sunday.

POLITICAL DEBT

The former Starehe legislator criticised leaders who think that they are owed political debt saying that no voter in Mt Kenya region will be manipulated or arm twisted to vote for anyone.

""We don't have anyone's debt, the only debt that mankind had had been paid by Jesus Christ. Let you not feel threatened by anyone, we don't owe anyone anything,"" he said.

The lawmaker hit out at Jubilee politicians allied to Tanga Tanga group. He accused them of undermining President Kenyatta by engaging in early campaigns.

Mr Kamanda said that Kenya has a single elected president who should be given time to focus on service delivery, especially on the Big Four Agenda.

""Let President Kenyatta be given time to serve his second term as he focuses on development and service delivery,"" he said.

Mr Kamanda called for political tolerance. He urged fellow politicians, especially those in the Tanga Tanga political wing of Jubilee, to desist from politics of violence.

VIOLENCE

On September 8, a church fundraiser at Gitui Catholic Church turned chaotic in Murang’a County after Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro stormed in and vowed to preside over the ceremony which was attended by Jubilee Party leaders affiliated to the Kieleweke group.

Mr Nyoro belongs to the Tanga Tanga faction which supports Deputy President William Ruto’s 2022 presidential bid.

""Some politicians go to church not to pray but to cause chaos, we do not want to witness such incidents in church again,” he said.

""The church must be respected and if anyone wants to play politics, let us go to a stadium,"" he added.

On the ongoing debate on calls for referendum, Mr Kamanda said that Kieleweke will support Building Bridges Initiative (BBI), an initiative birthed by the March 9, 2018 handshake between President Kenyatta and opposition leader Raila Odinga.

He tore into Thirdway Alliance's Punguza Migizo constitutional amendment Bill.

‘Life and death’ quest to find Mariga’s real age,['More This Author'],"By NYAMBEGA GISESA

More by this Author

Football star MacDonald Mariga started his third week as he has in his short political career — distracting from one controversy by plunging headlong into another.

His opponents in the Kibra Constituency by-election have questioned the validity of his age.

One of the key disputes is his identification number 29801496 which, going by the methodology the Department of Registration of Persons uses to issue ID numbers, does not tally with his stated age of 32 years.

Before he received his clearance to be the flag-bearer, Sunday Nation has learnt that the Jubilee Party questioned the authenticity of the footballer’s ID card during his interview in the party primaries.

The controversy over his age has gone on for several years.

Five years ago, a TV reporter who tried to inquire about his age was almost stabbed while another journalist received death threats.

Advertisement

HANDSHAKE

Other than his ID, various respectable sports websites have given contradictory information on when the football star was born.

Footballtop.com lists that he was born on April 4, 1984, making him to be 35 years old, while Soccerbase.com indicates his date of birth as April 4, 1987 (32 years).

In a previous interview, his father Nicholas Wanyama, said his year of birth as 1981. He has since given contradictory information on the same.

But the controversies about his candidature were not unexpected, either.

It first started with a section of the Jubilee Party leadership pronouncing that the party would not field a candidate during the by-election in respect of the “handshake” between President Uhuru Kenyatta and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga.

After a list was circulated revealing that he was among the hopefuls for the Jubilee Party ticket, the party’s Secretary-General Raphael Tuju denounced it.

VOTERS ROLL

In a turnaround, the party’s NEB cleared his name and nominated him as their candidate for the Kibra by-election, an act which led to the rest of the hopefuls disputing his nomination. They claimed that party functionaries had rigged him in.

Then, last Wednesday, the shocker came after the IEBC disqualified him from the race on grounds that his name could not be found in the 2017 voters register. He has since filed an appeal.

Logically speaking, Mr Mariga and the Jubilee Party are out of the Kibra Constituency by-election race.

Mr Mariga was hoping to be among the footballers who have left the playing fields of football for that of politics, notable among them the legendary Milan and Chelsea striker Andriy Shevchenko, who scored goals for fun throughout his playing career, 1994 World Cup winner Romario and former PSG, AC Milan and Monaco striker George Weah, who is now the President in Liberia.

Mariga was the trailblazer in Kenyan football after he became the first Kenyan to play in Italy, Spain, in the Champions League and almost played at the English Premier League were it not for a work permit glitch.

He won the competition with Inter Milan in 2010, although as an unused substitute in the finals against Bayern Munich but featured in the legendary semi-final against Barcelona.

At the height of his career in January 2010, Mariga was set to sign for English Premier League champions Manchester City, but the deal fell through after he failed to obtain a work permit before the transfer deadline, which stalled the move.

The footballer-now-turned politician made his debut for national team Harambee Stars when he was still a secondary school student.

While still a student, he played for Ulinzi, Tusker and Kenya Pipeline football clubs before he sat for his KCSE exams.

SPORTING FAMILY

He signed with Swedish club Enköpings SK in 2005 and then Helsingborg, Parma and, in February 2010, Mr Mariga joined Inter Milan for a transfer fee of five million pounds.

At Inter Milan, he became the first Kenyan to feature for the UEFA Champions League.

At the beginning of the 2011/12 season, he was loaned to Real Sociedad from Spanish top division and then moved on loan to Parma for a short spell and then Real Oviedo.

Though unmarried, the footballer has a daughter who is now aged eight years.

The footballer comes from a sporting family. His father, Noah Wanyama, played for AFC Leopards in the 1960s, later rising to become the team’s coach.

His brothers Victor, Thomas and Sylvester, have also participated in various sports.

PALATIAL HOME

Victor, who is the team captain at Harambee Stars, has been playing for premier league club Tottenham Hotspur.

His younger brother Thomas, who is aged 30, plays for Mathare United as a defender while Sylvester is a former Sony Sugar football club defender.

Thomas has also played for Sofapaka and Mathare United. Of his sisters, Mercy was named the most valuable basketball player in the league in 2017, while Volnet and Cynthia have won trophies in professional basketball and netball, respectively.",https://www.nation.co.ke/image/view/-/5273574/medRes/2444396/-/ospbrm/-/MARPIC.jpg,[],https://www.nation.co.ke/news/politics/Finding-real-age-of-Mariga/1064-5273564-139v5hw/index.html,2019-09-15 02:00:00
How National Bank was brought to its deathbed,['More This Author'],"By JOHN KAMAU

More by this Author

After 50 years of a troubled run, the National Bank of Kenya, as we knew it, has come to an end.

In between, it was a citadel of thieves and charlatans and a case study of how to bring down a bank.

Once upon a time, the politically correct would walk into the bank and walk out with unsecured loans.

Parastatals and their heads would also take out loans they were not planning to pay back, and the Treasury would continue to pump more money into the bottomless pit.

Officially opened in November 1968 to help Kenyans access credit and control their post-independence economy, NBK — as it was better known — has now been merged with KCB, which was also bedevilled by the same mismanagement crisis of the Nyayo era but managed a comeback.

When the National Bank was founded, it was hoped that it would quickly be rolled out into rural areas as a commercial outfit while the Co-operative Bank of Kenya would cater for the emerging cooperatives in the countryside, where settler capitalism was still in place.

But, as Treasury found out, the bank had few branches and the British-run banking behemoth known as National and Grindlays had an intriguing network in both urban and rural towns.

KIBAKI'S APPOINTMENT

The only solution in the hands of the new finance minister — Mwai Kibaki — who had come to the helm after the December 1969 General Election — was to approach Lord Aldington, then the chairman of National and Grindlays, and his Africa manager JC Sheen and persuade them to sell their bank.

Behind the scenes, the Jomo Kenyatta government was nationalising various sectors of the economy, and that explains why after only a few weeks in office, and when National Bank was only 14 months old, Mr Kibaki called a press conference in January 1970 and announced that the government would buy a controlling stake in the British bank, and that National Bank would hold 60 per cent shareholding of the lender.

In London, Mr Kibaki was viewed positively by diplomats, and they said as much.

Ian McCluney, the then-British High Commissioner in Nairobi, wrote to Mr JW Lonie, Chancellor of the Exchequer, and told him that Mr Kibaki’s appointment was “likely to be very much to our advantage”.

That letter, dated January 27, 1970, paved the way for Mr Kibaki’s official visit to the British exchequer that April where he had a well-publicised meeting with Mr Lonie.

ABLE LEADER

In one of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) documents filed on Mr Kibaki, he was described as one of the key elite figures in Kenya — “the most capable, intelligent and potentially effective.”

That explains why any decisions that he took on the National Bank were never questioned, locally or abroad.

But some of the complaints that Mr Kibaki had inherited was that the British-owned banks were not lending money to Africans in the expected numbers.

The banks then argued that the locals did not have collateral — a problem that had curtailed the development of commerce.

The bulk of the criticism for not lending enough to Africans was levelled against Lord Aldington’s National and Grindlays, and the bank openly acknowledged it.

When confronted with such accusations, Lord Aldington always had an answer: “It is not in anyone’s interest for banks to lend money which people cannot pay back. It is not good for farmers, businesses or Kenya. We would be letting down Kenya if we indulged in bad banking. We are welcomed here because we are good bankers.”

But Lord Aldington was more than a banker. He was a good friend of Kenya’s minister for Agriculture, Bruce McKenzie, and would be used by the FCO to pass messages from London to President Kenyatta as a trusted non-official channel.

POLICY SHIFT

With the appointment of Mr Kibaki and the trust the British had in him in building the local banking sector, the birth of both the National Bank of Kenya and the takeover of National and Grindlays was a smooth exercise.

The National Bank was born in this environment, and in the hope that it would offer the local entrepreneurs a platform to grow their trade and expand their businesses.

While initially the Treasury’s shares in National and Grindlays were to be held by the National Bank of Kenya, Mr Kibaki made a policy shift and registered Kenya Commercial Bank Limited, which was to own 60 per cent shareholding in National and Grindlays.

The bank would also be renamed Kenya Commercial Bank. That left National Bank of Kenya somehow in limbo.

Within the government, it was decided that the National Bank’s growth should be slowed down in order to give KCB a chance to become Kenya’s number one bank.

FIXED DEPOSIT

As a result, NBK was not allowed to venture out to the rural areas.

Actually, by 1982, NBK had only opened just eight branches countrywide and the countryside was left to KCB and Co-operative Bank.

In the early 1990s, the NBK became the playground of charlatans and the National Social Security Fund (NSSF) found a place to put money in fixed deposits.

In the 1991-92 financial year, for instance, NSSF executed a fixed deposit of Sh2 billion of workers’ contributions.

When it was due for withdrawal, the NSSF was told that there was no money, and the game that ensued ended in the debt being converted into equity.

EQUITY

That is how NSSF became one of the largest shareholders in banks. Its money was stolen and the debts converted to equity.

The NSSF was actually being used to bail out banks caught up in the Nyayo-era financial mess and then forced to take shares.

Why the Fund did not loan National Bank this amount but illegally turned it into equity is one of the banking notorieties of the Moi era.

The NSSF would put workers’ money in collapsing banks such as Postbank Credit and others.

The NBK never managed to put its house in order and was bedevilled by a myriad of problems.",https://www.nation.co.ke/image/view/-/5273556/medRes/2444409/-/10lqcoa/-/kampic.jpg,[],https://www.nation.co.ke/news/politics/How-National-Bank-was-brought-to-its-deathbed/1064-5273530-xxdwax/index.html,2019-09-15 02:00:00
Ruto's chances to network hit a snag as foreign trips dwindle,['More This Author'],"By WANJOHI GITHAE

More by this Author

Deputy President William Ruto is increasingly getting sidelined by his boss, President Uhuru Kenyatta, when it comes to foreign trips, the Sunday Nation can reveal.

In the last one year, the DP has only made two trips, one to Congo Brazzaville and another to London, United Kingdom, with the latter being cut short by State House.

As is the norm within government, any member of the Cabinet who wishes to travel out of the country has to get a nod from State House.

In September 2018, Mr Ruto, accompanied by the President’s younger brother Muhoho, went on an extensive tour of Congo Brazzaville.

In February, he travelled to the United Kingdom and delivered a speech at Chatham house where he outlined what he believed should be included in constitutional amendments.

On February 8, he delivered his speech titled “Challenges encountered while managing change in a diverse country.”

The London trip was cut short that evening just before he could travel to Warwick University for a public lecture after State House informed him that President Kenyatta was to travel to Ethiopia the next day.

NETWORKING

Soy MP Caleb Kositany, who had accompanied him to the UK, said they had to call off the Warwick University engagement.

“I recall it clearly because we were to travel by road, a distance that would have taken us three hours. The DP had to call the Africa students leadership, which was headed by a Kenyan where he had lunch with them that Friday and promised them another visit,” he said.

Travels to foreign capitals are essential for establishing crucial international contacts especially for anyone nursing presidential ambitions.

With his foreign movements curtailed, Mr Ruto has not had a chance to cultivate such contacts with foreign leaders.

The norm in international diplomacy is that the President and his deputy should not be out of the country at the same time.

Mr Ruto’s trip to Canada and the United States that had been slated for May and June was called off at the last minute with sources indicating that the sudden cancellation was at the behest of State House.

Mr Ruto had been slated to meet the Kenyan community living in the Americas.

RAILA'S ROLE

The reason given then was that Mr Ruto’s trip would coincide with an official visit out of the country by the President.

Mr Ruto’s trip to the US, which was to take three weeks, would have seen him visit 15 states - including Washington DC where he was programmed to meet key members of the Congress.

Sources indicated that Mr Ruto was informed the President would be visiting Canada and it was impractical for them to visit the same country around the same period.

True to the communication, President Kenyatta visited Canada in early June where he attended a global conference on women and girls, with Kenyans living in the United States and Canada told by local organisers that Mr Ruto’s visit would be rescheduled.

The DP’s camp is said to be concerned about a growing trend where in trips he would ordinarily represent the President, Cabinet secretaries are being given the task.

On other occasions, Opposition leader Raila Odinga has been picked to represent the President, especially in trips around the continent where he is the African Union representative on Infrastructure.

Deputy President’s head of communications David Mugonyi denied that the DP has been sidelined. “I am not aware,” was his curt reply.

KEY EVENTS

Last month, Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i represented President Kenyatta in Mozambique to witness the historic signing of a peace accord between President Filipe Nyusi and the main opposition group, Renamo.

In April, Mr Odinga also represented the President at the burial of anti-apartheid icon Winnie Mandela.

In June 2018, Mr Odinga travelled to India where he held bilateral talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

In the same month, President Kenyatta’s decision to delegate Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary Monica Juma to represent him at the AU Summit elicited a heated debate online.

Reacting to the debate, State House explained that the President was engaged in urgent state matters throughout that weekend but steered clear of his deputy’s engagements.

“President @UKenyatta has been held back by urgent state matters and will not attend the African Union Summit in Nouakchott, Mauritania. The President has deployed Dr. Amb. Monica Juma, CS for @ForeignOfficeKE, to lead Kenya’s delegation to the summit this weekend,” tweeted State House.

Many Kenyans were of the impression that the President’s principal assistant should be the automatic choice to represent the Head of State at such events whenever the former is unable to attend.

MANDATE

In September last year, Ms Juma represented the President during the 33rd Extra Ordinary Session of the Assembly of Intergovernmental Authority on Development (Igad) Heads of State and Government on Peace Process in South Sudan and the admission of Eritrea to Igad in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia

In December, Ms Juma also represented the President on an official trip to the Kingdom of Jordan for the “Aqaba Process Follow-up meeting on East Africa” on the invitation by King Abdullah II.

Mr Kositany argues that while it is the President’s prerogative on who represents him in foreign capitals, it would have been only procedural that the Deputy President was given a chance.

“I believe it is the DP who should be going for these events. Ministers are too busy with their dockets, but then again, at the end of the day, it is the President who decides,” he said.

UHURU'S DISCRETION

Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja sees nothing odd in the manner in which the President is conducting foreign relations.

“There is nothing out of place as all who undertake official foreign service do so at the pleasure and discretion of the President. This also depends on the specific assignment and who he feels is best-suited.

""There is a substantive Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other CSs engage based on their dockets. Mr Odinga engages as AU special envoy, who fortunately also happens to be Kenyan which further serves our interest,” Mr Sakaja, who also doubles as vice-chair of Senate Defence and Foreign Relations Committee, said.

Past presidents have been known to delegate foreign travels to their deputies, especially founding President Mzee Jomo Kenyatta whose phobia for air travel was well documented.

When he ascended to power, President Daniel Moi changed the norm, hardly delegating such trips to his vice presidents.",https://www.nation.co.ke/image/view/-/5273318/medRes/2444280/-/wtytnm/-/RUTPIC.jpg,[],https://www.nation.co.ke/news/politics/William-Ruto-hits-a-snag-as-foreign-trips-dwindle/1064-5273284-480vk8z/index.html,2019-09-15 06:00:00

Punitive mission that led to birth of Nyeri Town,['More This Author'],"By JOSEPH KANYI

More by this Author

In 1902, when British maverick Col Richard Meinertzhagen went to Nyeri on a punitive expedition against the people of Tetu, who had massacred an Arab caravan, he found a spot that would later mark the start of an administrative town.

At the base of Nyeri Hill, Col Meinertzhagen settled on a site, now believed to be at the car park of the Nyeri Club, and they built a tiny administrative centre.

In his notes, he says that after a bit of argument, he called it “Nyeri” - which was an incorrect spelling of the Kikuyu word “Nyîrî”.

From here they carried out punitive raids on the Kikuyu, taking their livestock and intimidating locals.

Meinertzhagen was later involved in the killing in cold blood of Koitalel arap Samoei in Nandi as he continued his escapades on behalf of the British empire.

This increases the significance of the Nyeri Hill as part of our heritage.

RESISTANCE

Situated six kilometres East of Nyeri Town and at 1,260 metres above sea level, the hill is one of the main physical features within Nyeri.

It dwarfs Kamatoongu and Sangare hill (also known as Thung’aari) in Kieni, Nyambugichi hill near Taanyai trading centre, Karima Hill in Othaya, Tumutumu hill and Nyena Hill in Mathira.

It’s the place where Col Meinertzhagen and Dr Sidney Hinde are credited with founding the modern-day Nyeri Town in October 1902 even as the Colonel waged provocative raids against the locals.

From the top of the hill, he felt secure. This was after he, as commander of the 3rd East African battalion of the King’s African Rifle-KAR, defeated a strong resistance from Kikuyu warriors in Murang'a that was led by Chief Wang’ombe wa Ihura.

The Kikuyu were defeated, giving way to the battalion to move further north to wage more wars.

The KAR, which was a multibattalion British colonial regiment, needed to set up a base where they could have an upper hand against local warriors and full control of the area security due to their growing interests, and Nyeri Hill was ideal.

The area was not only convenient, but also strategic for a base due to its high elevation and the central location to monitor the vast and prime highlands.

SPLENDID VIEW

Nyeri people call it different names depending on which area they are from.

Those living at Ihururu in Tetu call it Kamuhoya, which means Muhoya’s hill; while those living on the upper side of Tetu call it Githuuri, meaning a huge man, due to how it stands out like a big man. In other areas, it is widely known as Kianyiri, which simply means Nyeri Hill.

Standing at the top of the hill, one can see the Aberdare range on the west and Mt Kenya on the east.

At a 360 degrees turn, one can enjoy a breathtaking and pristine view of Kieni plains, Tetu, Othaya, Nyeri Town all the way to Mathira and a section of Kirinyaga County.

No wonder it was the choice of the colonial military post.

With sufficient security in the area, White Settlers trooped in in large numbers and occupied the fertile and virgin highlands and immediately started farming and engaging in other activities.

Some of these areas were not just privately owned by the settlers, but they were part of the Crown Land, a territorial area belonging to the monarch, and proceeds from the land were sent directly to the UK.

BUSINESS

From the period, a number of relics still stand, including Nyeri golf course, which is the second oldest in the country.

It was started by Reggie McClure and G. Sandbach Baker in 1910. The others are the White Rhino hotel founded in 1910 by Berkely Cole, Lord Cranworth and Sandy Herd, Outspan, which was built by hotelier Sherbrook Walker, Aberdare Country Club and Seremai House (now Sere Mwai), formerly owned by John Carberry and his wife Mary.

A resident who declined to give his name said the Nyeri Hill military camp was closed a year after the declaration of the state of emergency in 1952 after Chief Muhoya complained to then-colonial district governor following rampant claims of soldiers flirting with local girls and women at a local spring known as Nyaithenyu as they fetched water.

Muhoya won over the colonial administrator by telling him that there were no Mau Mau fighters in his jurisdiction, and therefore there was no need for a military base.

COFFEE FARMING

The chief's home was also at the foot of the hill near Ihururu town in Tetu and is remembered for pioneering dairy farming, and being the first local to built one of the oldest cattle dips in the county in 1936. The facility is still there but it has been neglected.

At the same hill, the Consolata missionaries from Italy set a centre on the northern side of the hill at Mathari where they introduced coffee farming and evangelised residents around 1906.

It was here where the first wet coffee mills technology was established in Kenya along the manmade river, Kalondon.

The technology was later applied in setting up other coffee factories, not only in the region but also in other coffee-growing zones.",https://www.nation.co.ke/image/view/-/5274670/medRes/2444983/-/sme0f8/-/towpic.jpg,[],https://www.nation.co.ke/lifestyle/travel/Punitive-mission-that-led-to-birth-of-Nyeri-Town/1950822-5274800-12oety3/index.html,2019-09-16 05:30:00
Mariga’s turbulent plunge into politics is nothing new to many Kenyan celebs,[],"Former Kenya international midfielder McDonald Mariga breathed a sigh of relief on Monday when he was cleared to contest for the vacant Kibra parliamentary seat.

His clearance by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) ended an anxious wait for Mariga whose nomination by the Jubilee Party had been invalidated last week.

And so Mariga now remains on course for political career that will see him following in the footsteps of other celebrities who have transitioned into politics.

Celebrities becoming politicians is not a new concept here in Kenya.

Some have won, while many other have seen their political ambitions going up in smoke.

Here are few Kenyan celebs who have turned to politics in recent years.

1. Mohammed Ali

The former KTN investigative journalist, who went to become Member of Parliament for Nyali constituency in the coast in the 2017 general election, initially lost the ODM nominations under controversial circumstances.

He jumped ship and vied as an independent candidate and won.

Even then his win was contested in court, before his victory was upheld.

Before joining politics Ali, though this work, exposed many hidden corruption cases in Kenya though his well investigative TV series Jicho Pevu.

2. Charles ‘Jaguar’ Kanyi

He is a recording artiste who went on to become the Member of Parliament for Starehe constituency in 2017.

Jaguar first made it to limelight as a recording artiste in 2004 when he recorded and released his first single Utaweza Kweli.

In 2005 he recorded and released several singles among them his most popular hit single Kigeugeu.

With Kigeugeu in the airwaves across the country, Jaguar was now a household name in the country.

He vied for and won the Starehe seat against another celebrity candidate activist Boniface Mwangi.

3. Sabina Chege

She started out as an actress in the local TV series Tausi.

She later become a radio presenter, before joining politics in 2013 when she was elected the Woman Representative for Muranga county.

She retained the seat in the 2017 general election.

Ms Chege is also the Chairperson of the Parliamentary Committee on Health in the National Assembly.

4. Gathoni wa Muchomba

Wa Muchomba moved from the radio waves to become a Woman Representative in Kiambu County in 2017.

Before trying out politics Wa Muchomba had been the queen of vernacular radio stations from 1999 when she was working for Kameme FM.

In the 2017 general election, She declared her interest in the Kiambu Woman Rep seat which she ultimately won.

5. McDonald Mariga

The former Kenyan international whose current market value as a footballer is said to be Sh34.3 million made an unlikely move some time last month following the death of former Kibra MP Ken Okoth.

Before the Kibra by-election, Mariga kept a low profile, only making headlines because of his football career.

Right from the onset, Mariga’s political move has been fraught with numerous obstacles which have further divided the Jubilee Party.

His candidature has been the subject of opposition both within and without the party circles.

In that ruling, IEBC’s Dispute Resolution Committee reversed the verdict of the Kibra Returning Officer and allowed Mariga to contest in Kibra.

“I am relieved and happy that justice has prevailed. Now we get down to work,” Mariga said.

The decision to clear the former Kenyan international midfielder was also well received by Senate’s Majority Leader Kipchumba Murkomen.

‘VAR DECISION’

“On the Mariga goal earlier ruled for offside, the referee after a detailed analysis of the VAR (Video Assistant Referee) register has concluded that it was a perfect goal. Play resumes with the opponents destabilized,” Murkomen said.

Former Senator Boni Khalwale also reacted with excitement to the news.

“The basic feature of democracy is the right to participate in elections either as a voter or candidate. This is enshrined in our constitution,” Khalwale said.

He said on closer examination, he realised that what he was seeing was actually a zebra with melanin disorder. It was hardly a week old, it appeared weak and very different from the others for it has not stripes and was stuck close to a female adult zebra, probably its mother.

The discovery caused stampede in the reserve with tour drivers and photographers, hurriedly taking tourists to the lookout area in the game reserve near the Mara River for the rare find that has remained the top story in the Mara for the last three days.

The tourists have been taking extra clips of this rare holiday experience.

Hundreds of tour vans surrounded the already scared foul, and, according to Mr Felix Migoya the Mara tour guides and drivers association secretary, it created “an additional wonder” for international tourists who are in the reserve to for the last moments of the wildebeest migration.

The zebra has a rather amazing dark colour due to a genetic abnormality linked to the amount of melanin, affecting the pigmentation of the fur.

MARA’S FIRST

According to a wildlife specialist at Matira Camp Parmale Lemein, there has never been any recorded case in the Mara of such a rare zebra.

But he was quick to point out that none of the Zebras with such condition in other parks in Africa, according to research, has survived for more than six months after birth.

Due to other abnormalities of this nature, some scientists claim that zebra stripes are formed from the inhibition of melanin and that the “default” colour of a zebra is black. In other words, a zebra is black with white stripes.

ZEBRA STRIPES

Zebras stripes, according to researchers, work to ward off hordes of biting flies that the animals come in contact with on a daily basis and without the protection, such Zebras may be vulnerable.

Animals with albinism have been documented in a variety of other species including giraffes, penguins, orangutans and mice.

A few years ago at the Serengeti a zebra with blonde, rather than black stripes, was spotted and photographed. It was said to have much less melanin than typical zebras.

BLONDES

Until now, very few blonde zebras have been seen in the wild, although there are a few dozen living on a private reserve in Mount Kenya National Park.

Interestingly, the blonde male zebras at this private reserve behave like “stallions with harems”, according to Ren Larison, a biologist at the University of California.

However, while mating is not an issue for zebras with partial albinism, they could face other challenges.",https://nairobinews.nation.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Zebra-Dotted-F.jpg,[],https://nairobinews.nation.co.ke/news/rare-blacker-zebra-spotted-in-maasai-mara-causes-a-stir,2019-09-16 11:45:41
Unclaimed bodies at Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital mortuary identified,[],"Seven out of nine unclaimed bodies that have been lying at the Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital mortuary in Nairobi have finally been identified.

The bodies, which have been lying at the facility for almost four months, were identified by homicide detectives following a request by the hospital’s management to the team for help in the identification process.

IDENTIFIED BODIES

The Medical Superintendent at the hospital, Dr Musa Mohamed, said they wrote to the detectives on September 8 for an intervention before the team conducted the tests releasing the results on Saturday.

He said the identification was done through the use of fingerprints taken from the bodies.

However, the identification process of two of the nine bodies is yet to be completed but Dr Mohamed gave an assurance that the hospital is still working on ways of identifying the bodies.

Those identified are Eugine Wabure Wechuli (ID number 31942404), Peter Macharia Mwango (ID 35626948), Samuel Etili Aiyamai (ID 29601734), and Daniel Oruru Amuzama (14433995).

Others are Raphael Kwetu Kasamani (25780813), Dismas Leokono (21852126) and Benjamin Boma Wasike (24205386).

“We are now calling for the families of the identified bodies to come forward and pick the bodies for burial or disposal,” said Dr Mohamed on Monday.

ACCRUED BILLS

Governor Mike Sonko said the county government will waive accrued morgue bills for those who will show up to collect the bodies but are not able to clear such bills.

“If the relatives feel they cannot afford picking their bodies as a result of lacking money to offset outstanding bills, we have mechanisms of helping out which could include waivers on the charges,” said Mr Sonko.

Dr Mohamed stated that most of the bodies at the hospital are victims of road accidents, adding that the hospital’s emergency department receives patients from across the country where in some cases, the patients have no documents to ascertain their identity.

“We occasionally receive accident victims whose identity is not known or have no relatives accompanying them when being admitted for treatment and that is why we involved the homicide police to help us,” he said.

City Hall has been grappling with increasing numbers of unclaimed bodies in its health facilities with the county raising alarm over the issue as the numbers hit 273 as at early this month.

City Mortuary, Mbagathi Hospital and Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital mortuaries are some of the most affected hospitals with untaken bodies still lying at the facilities’ morgues with City Mortuary having 172 unclaimed bodies, Mbagathi 97 and Mama Lucy 9.

Last month, City Hall even advertised for the collection of the unclaimed bodies across the county hospital mortuaries.",https://nairobinews.nation.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Mama-Lucy-Kibaki-Hospital.jpg,[],https://nairobinews.nation.co.ke/life/unclaimed-bodies-at-mama-lucy-kibaki-hospital-mortuary-identified,2019-09-16 11:35:48
Mariga scores crucial ‘goal’ as IEBC clears him to contest Kibra by-election – VIDEO,[],"Footballer-turned-politician McDonald Mariga has been cleared to run in the forthcoming Kibra by-election.

The ruling was delivered on Monday morning by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) Disputes Resolution Tribunal, which determined that Mariga is a duly registered voter.

TWISTS AND TURNS

The decision now paves way for Mariga to contest for the vacant parliamentary seat on a Jubilee Party ticket.

This is the latest dramatic turn of events in what has been a series of twists and turns in Mariga’s quest for the parliamentary seat in the mini-poll scheduled for November 7.

Mariga petitioned the IEBC after Kibra Returning Officer Beatrice Muli invalidated his nomination, on the grounds that his name was missing from the register of voters.

But while delivering his ruling, IEBC Chairman Wafula Chebukati, as the chair of the IEBC’s Dispute Resolution Committee, stated that Mariga was a duly registered as a voter.

“It is our finding that the complainant was duly registered as a voter and subsequently issued with an acknowledgement card,” said Chebukati.

He further said that every document presented by Mariga was authentic.

It also emerged that Mariga registered himself at the Kariokor Social Hall in 2019.

ONE MORE HURDLE

Chebukati went on to direct the Kibra Constituency Returning Officer to clear Mariga to enable him proceed with campaigns for the by-election.

“The respondent is hereby ordered to process the complainant’s application for nomination as the Jubilee Party candidate for the Kibra constituency by-election slated for November 7, 2019,” Chebukati said.

Appearing before the committee, on Friday Muli defended her decision, saying Mariga’s name was not in the voter register and clearing him would be a breach of the law and election regulations.

She further confirmed that the ICT voters’ registration list was up to date, but could not verify whether the hard copy version was updated.

But Mariga’s legal team led, by lawyer Elisha Ongoyi, pushed Muli to admit an error on her part and pleaded with the committee to rectify the ‘mistake’ by overturning the decision.

Ongoya told the committee that Mariga is properly registered as a voter, citing the acknowledgement slip issued in Starehe Constituency on September 26 as sufficient proof.

Mariga is however still left with one more hurdle after a voter in the constituency by the name Leina Konchellah contested allege inconsistency in his national identity card.

Unapologetic Ngunjiri Wambugu drives the wedge between Uhuru and Ruto,[],"Nyeri Town Member of Parliament Ngunjiri Wambugu has further fueled animosity within an already divided Jubilee Party by declaring that the working relationship between President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy, William Ruto, is ‘dead’.

The vocal legislator has also chided the deputy president for going against President Kenyatta’s directive by going around the country to launch ‘development’ projects.

BROKEN RELATIONSHIP

“In my option what the president was saying at that moment he talked about Ruto Tanga tanga, was a friendly warning to his assistant,” Wambugu said on Sunday.

Wambugu also claims the relationship between President Kenyatta and his deputy was broken when the latter politicized development projects.

“Because you are politicizing the development people won’t support your political position, they don’t accept it,” added Wambugu.

Wambugu, who was speaking on K24’s Punchline, said going forward the unity of the Jubilee Party “entirely depends” on the DP’s actions.

The legislator went on to claim that the DP, despite assurances from President Kenyatta of his support in 2022, went ahead to embark on early campaigns four years to the next election.

SUCCESSION POLITICS

About Jubilee Party making it through to 2022 as a political party, Wambugu says all will depend entirely how Kieleweka and TangaTanga teams will play it out.

“We have a split because one group is campaigning for the Deputy President for 2022 and we have one team that is saying we have a president right now,” Wambugu added.

Wambugu also blamed Ruto for engaging in divisive political campaign in the Mount Kenya Region.

“Campaigns are divisive. They are made to divide people so that to get some people to support you and then some people will not support you. What you are doing deliberately is dividing people,” said Wambugu.",https://nairobinews.nation.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Uhuru-Ngunjiri-Ruto.jpg,[],https://nairobinews.nation.co.ke/general/unapologetic-ngunjiri-wambugu-drives-the-wedge-between-uhuru-and-ruto,2019-09-16 16:00:45
How police bungled case of carjacker who stole former NTV employee’s ID,[],"Last week, detectives arrested two people they believed to be a part of a criminal ring behind car thefts at Thika Road Mall (TRM), Garden City Mall and its environs.

While making public the arrests, the police said the two suspects – Kelvin Mokaya and Moses Alimlim – often pose as gym members and then access the changing rooms, steal car keys before driving away with stolen vehicles.

LOST WALLET

The two where later arraigned in court.

But the whole incident has now taken a new twist after it emerged that one of the suspects used an identification card he had stolen from the said gym and identified himself as Kelvin Mokaya.

Apparently, the police had caught their man, but fell for his false identification.

Mr Mokaya is a former employee of NTV and is also a member of the gym located at TRM.

Speaking to Nairobi News Mokaya narrated how he recently lost his wallet which contained all his documents and his mobile phone at the gym.

He reported the matter at Kasarani Police Station on the same day and recorded a statement (OB No. 100/5/9/19).

According to Mokaya, he did not give much thought about it and because he was taking a short vacation, he called Safaricom and told them to deactivate his number just in case the thieves use his number because they had all his documents.

IDENTITY FRAUD

He only found out that using his names had been arrested a few days later on social media after friends started tagging him because no one could reach him.

After he returned to Nairobi, he went straight to Kasarani Police Station and asked about the progress of his case while at the same time inquiring about the latest development of a suspect who had used his stolen ID to identify himself.

An investigator at the police station, who is handling his case, said she was following up on the matter, this is even after Mokaya produced his passport to show that he was the same person on the ID and everything matched.

“While I’m not aware of the resemblance between the suspect and I, I feel that this is a case of incompetence within the police service as the investigating team did not take their time to verify if indeed the suspect was who he claims to be,” said Mokaya.

He wonders why the police did not take their time to go through the OB, especially when several claims of theft had been filed from the same location.

“Had they taken their time to check the reports from the scene where the arrest was made, they would have flagged this as case of identity fraud,” he added.

The suspect was arraigned at Makadara Law Court on September 11, 2019 under the same name to take a plea and was granted a cash bail of Sh20,000.

TAKEN TO COURT

Luckily he was yet to be released by the time Mokaya reported the matter.

Mokaya says almost a week after he presented himself to the Kasarani Police Station, only the court has given a production order for the suspect to be taken back to the police station for them to prepare fresh charges before taking him to court.

He adds that the police have been dragging their feet on this matter and are yet to take even his statement.

“I have spent the last five days visiting the station and requesting them to take my statement and also check the documents in possession of the suspect to verify if they are mine but this is yet to happen,” he says.

According to Mokaya, all he wants is to have his name cleared in the matter.

“I therefore call upon the relevant authorities to look into this matter so that is expedited and that I may be cleared to go back to my normal life,” he says.

Ugandan Speaker warns MPs against engaging in reckless sex,[],"Speaker of the Ugandan Parliament, Rebecca Kadaga, has advised lawmakers and protocol officers not to engage in ‘reckless’ sex during the forthcoming Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference.

The 64th edition of this conference is set for the Resort Hotel in Kampala between September 22 and 29.

About a thousand delegates, including speakers and parliamentarians from across 180 Commonwealth nations, are expected to attend.

In light of this, Kadaga has urged her lawmakers to shun the temptations of entering visitors’ rooms.

“When you take them (delegates) to their rooms, stop at the door, you can put in the luggage together with the hotel waiter but don’t loiter in these rooms. Do your work and leave,” Kadaga said.

Kadaga also said that it doesn’t make sense to get intimate with someone you will probably never meet again, explaining that her country has a history of several babies born of fathers who disappeared without a trace.

“You know when the Tanzanians came to this country (to fight former president Idi Amin), there was excitement and a number of children were born in this country. We know their mothers but we don’t know their fathers… Don’t take risks. A man from Jamaica, when will you see him again? And for the men, a woman from the Pacific, Naulu, when will you ever reach there? So you may just be very careful with what you do,” she said.

Media ejected from Sh1.7 billion City Hall AAR medical scheme scandal probe,[],"The controversial Sh1.7 billion AAR Kenya medical insurance scheme for City Hall staff has reared its ugly head again with media being thrown out of a watchdog committee sitting probing the scandal.

Journalists were asked to leave the Nairobi County Assembly Public Accounts Committee (PAC) with members of the committee divided on the exclusion.

This was after Nairobi acting County Secretary Leboo Morintat called for the media to be excluded from the meeting.

The watchdog committee is grilling more than seven members of the county executive regarding their role over the contentious Sh1.7 billion county staff medical insurance.

Nairobi County government is on the spot for paying more than Sh652 million in excess of the medical scheme’s contract term of Sh1.07 billion.

According to the Auditor General’s report for the financial year ending June 30, 2018, City Hall made a total payment of Sh1.73 billion to AAR Insurance Kenya Limited although the contract sum was Sh1.07 billion.

“Although the total payment made so far to AAR Insurance Kenya Limited is Sh1, 725, 488, 939, no explanation has been given for paying Sh652, 786, 602 in excess of the contract sum of Sh1, 072, 702, 337,” read the report in part.

In addition, a comparison of the annual contract sum shows unexplained growth in value of the insurance cover even though there was decrease in number of staff by 402 during the year under review.

In financial year ending June 30, 2016, the number of employees were 13, 348 with the contract value of Sh346.3 million, the same for 2016/2017 which had 13, 097 employees.

In the financial year ending June 20, 2018, the contract sum for the medical insurance scheme shot up exponentially to Sh1.1 billion although the number of the employees had reduced to 12, 695. Currently there are 12, 499 employees at the county.

This is not the first that the officer is doing the same. In July, the acting County Secretary also asked for the media to leave the committee sitting before he could answer any queries regarding the controversial AAR medical cover. The request was also granted at the time.

Most members of the committee, five out of six, protested the request but despite their opposition, the chair of the committee Wilfred Odalo granted Mr Morintat his wish. Only Kilimani MCA Moses Ogeto supported the move.

Minority whip Peter Imwatok and Karen MCA David Mberia said it was frivolous for the executive to call for exclusion of the media with no justifiable reasons why he wanted to speak in camera.

“Throwing the media out will paint the county in bad light as this is not the first time this officer has done this. The public will not forgive this committee if this will be the trend,” said Mr Imwatok.

“There is nothing to hide as we are discussing matters of public concern. This is the second time this officer is making the request. Last time it was also granted,” said Mr Mberia.

Sarang’ombe MCA Lawrence Otieno and Ngei MCA Redson Otieno agreed with Mr Imwatok saying: “The media has to stay because the public wants to know how their money was spent. Why is the member always fearful and constantly wants the media excluded when he appears before us?”

The exclusion of the media came after intense lobbying to have the committee cancel the sitting failed. The committee which was to start at 10.30am was suspended for several hours only to start at 1.10 pm as the chair was under extreme pressure to ensure that the committee does not hold the sitting.

Interestingly, only ODM-allied members of the committee present at the meeting as their Jubilee counterparts who had come for the sitting soon left.

One of the Jubilee MCAs told the Nation that they were threatened by their party leadership that they will be de-whipped if they attended the sitting.

“We have been told in no uncertain terms that we should not attend the session and those who will, will be de-whipped from committees,” said the MCA who did not want to be identified for fear of victimisation.

The committee has lately been under pressure for unearthing malpractices at the executive and their hard hitting reports with members being accused of colluding with the media to expose Governor Mike Sonko’s administration.

Mr Leboo has been cited by the committee for being a ‘malicious’ witness for repeatedly failing to appear before it on various sittings.

This prompted the committee to invite him, together with six other officers, for the last time yesterday or they risk being arrested.

The AAR cover has come under stern scrutiny since the deal was signed with former Governor Evans Kidero’s administration in 2015 where the firm has been earning between Sh1.06 billion and Sh1.3 billion every year.

The firm’s contract with the county government was to end on June 30, 2017, but Governor Sonko’s administration extended the deal by three months to allow time for fresh procurement. This led to outcry from a section of the MCAs who filed a case in court.

In January this year, Kenya County Government Workers Union raised alarm over lack of a medical cover following revelations that county staff had stopped receiving the cover from December 31, 2018.",https://nairobinews.nation.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DNCITYHALL1209B-1200x630.jpg,[],https://nairobinews.nation.co.ke/news/media-ejected-from-sh1-7-billion-city-hall-aar-medical-scheme-scandal-probe,2019-09-16 18:30:31
Transgender activist Audrey Mbugua gets updated KCSE certificate,[],"Transgender activist Audrey Ithibu Mbugua has been issued with a new Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) examination certificate.

This is after the high court ruled in favour of Audrey’s bid to have her named changed from Andrew Mbugua to Audrey Mbugua.

The Kenya National Examinations Council (Knec) however challenged the ruling at the court of appeal, which however upheld the decision.

Audrey took to social media on Monday to share her joy of finally getting the academic paper capturing her new gender identity.

“I am happy KNEC complied with the orders of the court and issued me with a new certificate. I urge other transgender people who have changed their names to apply for new certificates. I thank all those who supported me and my transgender family. You chose the side of winners and you definitely chose justice,” she posted on facebook.”



Audrey, was born and raised as Andrew Ithibu Mbugua and during his secondary education, he attended Kiambu High School, a boys only school, where he sat his KCSE exam in 2001 and scored a mean grade of A- (minus).

Like other certificates, Ms Mbugua’s was inscribed with the mark ‘M’ denoting the male gender. The mark has now been changed to ‘I’ to signify intersex.

In January 2012, by gazette notice, she renounced the name Andrew and assumed ‘Audrey Ithibu Mbugua’.

She then requested Knec to effect the changes in her exam certificate but the council dismissed her request forcing her to move to court.

High court Justice Weldon Korir ruled in her favour but in opposing the ruling at the appellate court, Knec argued that the certificate was issued based on the registration particulars “under which he registered for the examination”.

The appellate court went ahead and upheld the high court decision, compelling Knec to change her academic certificate to reflect ‘her’ new identity.

Primary school pupil shocks Kenyans with foul-mouthed self-recorded video,[],"Kenyans on social media were for the better part of Sunday dumbfounded by the shocking contents of a video uploaded by a pupil at Consolata School in Nairobi.

The video, which was posted on the boy’s Instagram account, captured him hurling obscenities at a classmate whom he claimed had spread rumours about him being gay.

VULGAR

The class four pupil went on to issue threats to the said school mate, whom he kept on referring to as Nikita.

The pupil in question later pulled down the controversial videos on Sunday from his social media and put up an apology video.

“I know it wasn’t right for me to use the vulgar language and for that, I apologize. On my part, I know I overreacted and for that I’m sorry,” he said.

In screenshots making rounds on social media, the said Nikita’s father said he has reached out to Consolata School and his has also talked to his daughter.

“Nikita’s reaction I have gathered is from some other comments made by the boy himself,” read part of the message.

The girl’s father has also said since the incident, other parents from the school have reached out to him about the behaviour of the boy in the video.

“Many parents have in boxed me citing their children being bullied by the same boy. I urge them to raise it with the school,” he said.

COUNSELLING

Many Netizens said the young boy needed help and advised the parents to take him through counselling.

“ This boy needs alot of help… He’s struggling. More than meets the eyes. Young man your apology is accepted next time when apologizing don’t use the word ” “BUT” Fellow Kenyans let’s say No to Cyber Bullying this kid needs Love, guidance and counseling psychology,” said Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko.

“At the age of 11 years, l was sent to Approved School. I had run away from home and l was convicted of ‘vagrancy.’ At 14 years, I was expelled from an approved school. The Consolata Boy belongs in approved, he will find teachers and boys who can teach him lessons on how to behave,” he added.

“Not listening to the show but this is the main reason I don’t let kids watch reality TV or E news man. It’s called Television “Programming”. Ya’al still don’t get it. Don’t blame the kids, blame the environment they’re exposed to,” commented @AllanKMachogu

“That being said we also need to handle this with utmost care because thats just a kid and he can learn and get better.

Most millennial are money-illiterate and it’s not our fault,[],"I’m a millennial. I was born at a point of human history characterized by trail-blazing technological advancement leading to material abundance, at least as far as food, school and things are concerned.

School for us was literally a Basic Human Right. So were vaccines and lots of other things that just 100 years prior were literally alien.

Sandwiching all those nice things were endless hours of strict instruction in math, science, history, etc. The reasoning at the time was that we needed to know these things for us to be useful members of society. We had other views. We felt it akin to internment or slavery. And were those hours long! 12 years long, to be precise. (Sound familiar?) 12 years of early mornings, long boring lectures and for those of us in the boarding school cohorts, horrible food and personal abuse.

RARE PRACTICAL INFORMATION

However, if one could withstand the physical tedium, as well as the hodgepodge of ngeli, vitenzi and organic chemistry, there was a wealth of theoretical and (rarely) practical information and basic skillsets to be learnt. That’s why most of our black selves in whatever capacity of our current lives at least understand one basic grammatical tenet or the other of the earlier-alien English language (100 years in history is nothing). If it’s not that, some of the chemistry or biology or computer or the other is actively aiding your existence at this point in time.

The most curious omission, however, of the millennial book therapy, is money. How to make it, how to keep it, how to use it. How it works, but most importantly, how to make, keep and use it.

Why do I say curious? Because we were told our schooling would aid our seamless assimilation into society. There is no shortage of articles in print and in light written by dinosaurs using the word ’millennial’ in the most condescending way it can be used. The literature mainly addresses our supposed shortcomings when it comes to winning the cheese in a rat race. Perhaps, in hindsight, there would be fewer of these if someone had the foresight then to teach us a bit more about money.

TEETHING FINANCIAL SYSTEM

This is not to say that all of us have hopeless credit scores or account balances, but come on. The stuff is literally so commonplace in today’s world that the saying goes it makes the world go round! It’s particularly bad in the so-called Third World where our lateness on the stage of this particular play means we’re still technically teething when it comes to the capitalistic financial system.

Student loans and bad financial choices threaten to cripple most of us before we even realize we have legs and I place this blame squarely on the education system we were subject to. It failed to equip all of us with valuable lessons and advice on the basic workings of something that was to define our very existence.

And schools are not the only ones to blame. The domestic side of life bears almost as much culpability, if not more. Home was to a lot of us a seemingly-permanent river of material satisfaction. Behind all the video-games, toys, sweets, clothes, etc that were lavished upon us was a financial transaction of one kind or the other. These things were given to us, in fairness to our custodians, as signs of love!

HOW TO MAKE MONEY

However, as in most love stories, the tragedy was that in failing to show us how to make the money to buy the things ourselves, we find ourselves bamboozled by a world brimming with things waiting to be bought for one reason or another.

Hope is not absent, though. It is easier today than at any other time in human history to rapidly gain knowledge on anything, even if it is money. Money can be quickly and easily learnt just like those tantalising recipes and beauty regimes doing rounds online. And after it has been learnt, it HAS TO BE PASSED ON.

A millennial is generally identified as one born between 1981 and 2001. That means ALL of us have attained biological sexual maturity meaning we will (or already do) have children whom we MUST shield from the evils we perceive.

I talked to an older colleague about it once and she told me that if I don’t like the job, I should at least like what it does for me – pays my rent, gives me money to drink the weekend away and eat gourmet burgers I know very well that I can’t afford, etc.

Am I being a lazy and privileged millennial who is not grateful to be employed in these tough economic times? Should I just shut up put my head down and to do the job I was hired to do while I eat lunch with my three new best friends; Fuzu, Brighter Monday and LinkedIn?

Have I talked to my boss or my supervisor about some of the challenges that I am facing? Of course! We are millennial and if there is anything we love to do; it is to talk. I have presented my problems and possible solutions. Have they (yes they, because my bosses seemed to multiply conveniently after I reported to work) taken any of them? They are dead on arrival.

OUR TARGETS

No time for trial or exploration, we must meet our targets! Which is a corporate way of telling you “I’ve really got problems of my own.” For you to only discover that they had no real power to help you to begin with.

Why am I so angry and frustrated? Because this is not what I signed up for. When I came to work here, I wanted more than just a salary.

I wanted to learn, I wanted to grow – it was a career move that made sense and now I am going backwards. I am completely unmotivated and as a result my day to day intern-like tasks are suffering and the office is lucky if I show up before 10.

I am disheartened beyond words because I don’t want to be the lazy, thankless millennial that I have become. That’s not who I am, and that is not why I worked so hard to get here. We were always told to work hard!

But what if the work is easy and boring? Why are we working so hard? To what end? To get a promotion and earn more money to buy expensive alcohol? As much as that would be real nice, that’s what sponsors are for. And more importantly that is not the only reason I am here!

I want to innovate! I want to give real value to my employer! I want to produce work that I can be proud of! And who is supposed to help me do that? HR? They are too busy trying gossiping about the scandal of the week. What about the department head or the person at the top of the food chain?

They don’t take me seriously because I come late and I am a lazy thankless millennial. So my only solution is to continue with my best friends until one of them gives me an opportunity and we can do this all over again! Sounds like fun!",https://nairobinews.nation.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DN2Stressedteenager0209.jpg,[],https://nairobinews.nation.co.ke/blog/i-hate-my-job-and-the-people-i-work-with-sue-me,2019-07-26 17:30:40
"CITY GIRL: We all can learn from Collymore’s resilience, grit",[],"“It is not in the still calm of life or the repose of a pacific station, that great characters are formed … the habits of a vigorous mind are formed in contending with difficulties. Great necessities call out great virtues,” — Abigail Adams (mother of John Quincy Adams, in a letter to her son during the American Revolution)

Only a man of Bob Collymore’s fortitude and peerless resilience could say that his cancer diagnosis was ‘not a big deal’.

Of all the things that have been said and written about the fallen corporate chieftain, what stands out for me — and what has not been accorded its deserved prominence — was Bob’s grit, perseverance and resilience.

Resilience — the capacity to maintain ambition in the face of difficulties — was one of Bob Collymore’s most subtle yet most admirable traits, and the greatest lesson that we can learn from him.

Every stage of his life is punctuated by moments when Bob would be compelled to summon his resilience such that the story of his life is a tapestry of testimonies of the power of determination and resolve.

Whether as a 17-year-old when he was disappointed to realise he could not attend Warwick University because of lack of funding, or when he started his first job at age 12, his story is about strength, grit and courage.

Difficult times summon their leaders. When Bob took over Safaricom in 2012, the company was at a crossroads of sorts; it was a moment of uncertainty and he was confronted with the dilemma of filling the shoes of a great predecessor, Michael Joseph.

Guided by a strong sense of vision and powered by a clear moral purpose, Bob steeled himself for the journey ahead. He did not try to be like his predecessor, nor did he attempt to fit into anyone’s shoes.

MADE HIS OWN SHOES

Instead, he made his own shoes and now, it is up to Michael Joseph to fill Bob’s shoes. Talk about turnaround leadership!

With his supreme capacity to articulate the vision to those he led and inspired, Bob understood the mechanics of the human condition.

He took his time to know, befriend and relate with people at all levels, including those seemingly not within his social standing, a class act from a man who was in a class of his own.

But what Bob will be remembered for is not so much his corporate talents and capabilities, but in how he dealt with the most difficult moments in his life. We remember Bob not for his highest, most glorious moments, but for the man he was in his lowest moments.

To understand the true character of a man, you do not consider his moments of splendour and grandeur, but the man he is when giving up is the easiest way out. After all, difficulties and struggles are the crucible of character.

So we must remember who Bob was and what he espoused in those tough, excruciating moments as he underwent cancer treatment. We must consider the courage he exhibited when he came face-to-face with death. We must appreciate his attitude of gratitude when it was clear that he had ‘run out of options’.

It takes a man of valour to lead one of Africa’s most valuable companies, but it takes a man of great fortitude to bring himself to the realisation of the reality of death and prepare himself and his friends for the inevitable.

When it was clear that there was no escaping from the cancer, Bob said he had to ‘make friends with cancer’, in essence, accept the depth and breadth of the ugly truth and adjust his life to deal with the challenge. What a powerful, poignant lesson.

Even in those tough moments, he showed up for work, put up a brave face for his friends and family and kept the faith, living a day at a time.

I hope that when all is said and done, when the last rose is swept away from the church, when the headlines go mum, we will remember Bob not as the chief executive officer of Safaricom, but as the Guyanese boy who went to Britain first and then to rest of the globe and conquered the world.

Cancer might have conquered Bob, but the real hero is Bob, the man who taught me — and I hope you too — that resilience is truly the soul of life.",https://nairobinews.nation.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/BobCollymoreSpecialEd3-1.jpg,[],https://nairobinews.nation.co.ke/blog/city-girl-we-all-can-learn-from-collymores-resilience-grit,2019-07-06 09:00:12
"Ethic, the unlikely making of a millennial superstar music group",[],"It was on May 31, 2018 when Ethic Entertainment burst onto the music scene and changed the game.

Many people accused them of lacking content, of infecting the youth with evil thoughts as a result of their suggestive lyrics and finally being one-hit wonders.

Upon seeing their success, club promoter Teleh Mani decided to manage them and helped them collaborate with industry heavyweights Madtraxx and Mejja to give us ‘Position.’

They have never looked back; it has been hit after hit since, even after their bitter fall out with the manager (we are currently unsure of the status of the relationship).

What the haters seem to conveniently ignore is that these boys have created a whole new genre of Kenyan music – Gengetone. The mainstream media won’t play their music and videos because of its explicit nature? No problem!

Their fans will twerk to it on the dancefloor and rack up their views to a million and beyond in a short period.

DREAM OF

Something that many musicians in the country can only dream of.

Okay, so their music is not as exportable as some of our other artists, still they do not care.

They are not making music for the whole of Africa, they are making music for those friends and friends of friends who happened to show up during their first video shoot – which I believe was shot on a mobile phone.

Their talent and undeniable influence has been recognized by international label, Universal Music Group through their local subsidiary AI Records.

This partnership (because that is exactly what it is!) will only propel their influence even further.

With an international industry powerhouse behind them, they have given us ‘Figa’ which is their biggest hit yet.

IN ANTICIPATION

There are no words to describe the pandemonium effect the song has had but we will try.

Upon the release of the mere video teasers the group was trending in anticipation.

The video was directed by one of Kenya’s most renowned directors Vjone resulting in it already surpassing one million views within a few weeks of it being made public.

Nairobi senator Johnson Sakaja, in a recent interview on Radio Citizen, threw his support behind the boys saying: “These young guys were about to fall into crime if you know their story very well, but today they are earning a living so young people should follow their example.”

Which is another way to look at it. And they have with similar groups the Ochungulo Family, Rico Gang, Boondocks Gang and the many young men who are behind the hit “Wamblembez” following in their footsteps.

It is irrefutable that these are only the early days of Gengetone and we need not ignore them.",https://nairobinews.nation.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/BUZZETHICGROUPc.jpg,['https://www.youtube.com/embed/m1m2LDDLHnM'],https://nairobinews.nation.co.ke/blog/ethic-the-unlikely-making-of-a-millennial-superstar-music-group,2019-07-03 10:00:16
CITY GIRL: Starehe MP Jaguar represents everything a leader shouldn’t be,[],"Charles Njagua Kanyi (‘Jaguar’), MP for Starehe, is Kenya’s most ungainly mass of poor grammar, ignorance and hideous torn jeans that ever strolled the corridors of Parliament.

Politicians have the universal right to be foolish, but Jaguar has abused this right and the licence that all Kenyan politicians have to be stupid.

Following his xenophobic remarks against Tanzanian traders in Nairobi, I have concluded that Jaguar is the beau ideal of a semi-illiterate, backstreet hooligan who lacks the intellectual sophistication to grasp the full extent of the consequences of his utterances.

REJIG REAL NAME

I mean, you wouldn’t expect much from a grown man whose epitome of artistic creativity is to rejig his real name (Njagua) to match the brand name of a high-end automobile (Jaguar).

It was also too much to ask of a former musician — whose songs are barely literate compositions — to understand the breadth and depth of the East African Community integration and its immense benefits to Kenyans, including those he represents.

What Jaguar, a holder of a Bachelor’s degree in Peace Studies and Conflict Resolution from Mount Kenya University, does not seem to understand is that remittances from Kenyans abroad — including those in Tanzania — are at an all-time high of Sh197.1 billion, much more than our tea export earnings.

It doesn’t take a genius to understand that this money increasingly contributes to our much-needed forex reserves over and above supporting millions of Kenyans, including those in his constituency.

LACKS BANDWIDTH

Even if Jaguar lacks the bandwidth to understand this, it is common sense that such inflammatory remarks against foreigners in Kenya have potentially fatal consequences for Kenyans living in other countries.

Of all Kenyan MPs, Jaguar now has the dubious distinction and has earned himself an unflattering place in the history of this country as one of the few Kenyan leaders discussed in the Tanzanian parliament.

But besides this newly found fame in Tanzania, Jaguar, through his remarks, has endangered the lives of thousands of Kenyans living in Tanzania, if the words of a livid Tanzanian MP are anything to go by.

On the flip side, Jaguar may have a valid point. Life and business have become tougher for Kenyan traders in markets like Gikomba that are brimming with foreign traders from China, Uganda and Tanzania.

Salons and barbershops in downtown Nairobi, including on Moi Avenue and Tom Mboya Street, are teeming with Rwandese workers whose services are significantly cheaper than those of locals.

It is also worth noting that most of Jaguar’s electorate work and earn their keep from Gikomba and Wakulima markets, so it is indeed his business if foreigners are posing a threat to businesses owned by locals.

These are facts, and the situation could probably be the same in other countries like China and Tanzania, although my hunch is that these governments have done better to safeguard their local traders.

There are businesses and services conducted by foreigners locally that their governments would never allow Kenyans to conduct in those foreign countries.

Indeed, Kenyans who work and live in Tanzania will tell you of the suspicion with which they are treated and the unfairness they are subjected to — a matter that has been in the public domain for decades.

We also have cases where Kenyans have been appointed to plum jobs in Tanzania and have had their work permits denied for one reason or the other.

MISTREATMENT OF KENYANS

Of course, the mistreatment of Kenyans in other countries like Saudi Arabia is now nearly becoming a national crisis. Above all, the issue of foreigners conducting business in this country is a matter that needs to be dealt with in the long run — and Jaguar’s incident is a symptom of a bigger, underlying problem.

What Jaguar lacked was the tactfulness and the decorum to handle such a delicate matter, and his loose lips have left in their trail a diplomatic hailstorm that might have unintended consequences.

He spoke explicitly about violently smoking out Tanzanian traders, he gave the government an ultimatum and whipped up emotions among a frustrated, possibly poor electorate — and that is everything a leader should not do.

But then again, Jaguar reflects our society because he was the people’s choice — a people that had the option of Jaguar and the activist Boniface Mwangi.

My unsolicited advice to Jaguar is that while he means well for his electorate, wisdom must always be applied in delicate matters such as this. It also does not hurt to equip yourself with a few facts — even when they might be a bit difficult to grasp. As for kuvuka border, Jaguar should forget about that for now, until further notice.",https://nairobinews.nation.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/DNJAGUARCOURT2806s.jpg,[],https://nairobinews.nation.co.ke/blog/city-girl-starehe-mp-jaguar-represents-everything-a-leader-shouldnt-be,2019-06-29 06:30:11
CITY GIRL: Lonyangapuo a breath of fresh air in our politics,[],"There are governors, and then there is Prof John Krop Lonyangapuo—Governor for West Pokot.

I must admit that I did not know him prior to the famous “kijana fupi amenona round…mulmulwas” video that went viral early this year, in what will go down Kenya’s history books as the speech of the year.

No other speech in our history has elicited such immense ‘meme value’—the capacity for every sentence and every phrase to be reproduced and repackaged into a joke remains outstanding.

I will also be the first to admit that I had largely ignored the professor and dismissed him as just any other politician, until I watched his interview on Jeff Koinange Live two nights ago and that was when I realised that there is more to Prof Lonyangapuo than simple rhetoric.

This guy means business.

Well, I could be wrong because like any other politician, I have heard maybe one or two unflattering tales about the governor—which is why I am offering a disclaimer here—that time might just prove me wrong and I might have to swallow my words.

GOOD MAN, GREAT LEADER

But in the meantime, I will celebrate a seemingly good man and a great leader when I see one.

Away from the silly ‘mulmulwas’ jokes that have nearly become synonymous with Prof Lonyangapuo, it occurred to me that beneath that rhetoric and drama, is a man, a leader, who has made it his life purpose to demystify one of Kenya’s least known counties; West Pokot.

Listening to him—and I mean, really taking time to understand Prof Lonyangapuo—you realise that he is not only incredibly intelligent (he is a professor of applied mathematics), but also a shrewd politician keen on uplifting the lives of the good people of West Pokot.

If Makueni county have their Prof Kivutha Kibwana, West Pokot have in Prof Lonyangapuo an ambassador who is bent on not only changing their livelihoods but changing the ‘cattle rustlers’ narrative that has stuck for decades.

In the interview, Jeff Koinange desperately tried to hammer in the ‘cattle rustler’ and ‘primitive people’ narrative—which to me was a remarkable indication of a small and limited intellect becoming even smaller—but the good governor relentlessly and viciously fought against this description, categorically stating that “the Pokot people you used to know are not there now”.

It is one thing to be a great ambassador for your people, but it is another to have their interests at heart, and that is exactly what appears to me from the avalanche of feedback that poured in praising Prof Lonyangapuo for his efforts.

ADULT EDUCATION

Among his most admirable efforts is the fact that he has made it mandatory for everyone, young or old, in West Pokot to attend school, thereby introducing and mainstreaming adult education. A beneficiary of a good education, it is not lost on Prof Lonyagapuo that a good education is beneficial to society. I like people who value education because I too value education, which makes the professor one of my favourite politicians.

Given that Kenyans love a good-humoured politician who can once in a while throw a punch, and take some punches too, it is clear that Prof Lonyangapuo enjoys the goodwill and support of millions of Kenyans who are obviously smitten by him. The ‘mulmulwas’ video was the perfect icebreaker and debut into national limelight.

Plus, he is sort of ‘fresh blood’ being a first-time governor and former one-term senator so there is some excitement attached to this new and fresh voice, though not as young as we had hoped.

That said, the governor could leverage on this goodwill and perhaps use this newly-found national fame to give Kenyans the change of leadership that we have been yearning for decades.

In a country notorious for recycling leaders from the past, maybe Prof Lonyangapuo is the outsider and the breath of fresh air we have been waiting for.

DEMYSTIFY MYTHS

Besides serving the people of West Pokot, he could use this opportunity to demystify our myths and misconceptions about that forgotten county and who knows even use this position to raise a generation of leaders from West Pokot.

He seems to have some really good development ideas—including apparently leveraging on the foreign contacts of a deputy governor who lives and works in the US to solicit donor funding and medical equipment for his county.

I am just wondering if Kenyans are seeing what I am seeing. Are we looking at a future presidential candidate?",https://nairobinews.nation.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/DnEldPeace0910h.jpg,[],https://nairobinews.nation.co.ke/blog/city-girl-lonyangapuo-a-breath-of-fresh-air-in-our-politics,2019-06-22 06:30:48
CITY GIRL: Shaming and bullying of female leaders must stop,[],"My first encounter with Nairobi woman representative Esther Passaris was in 2013. As a cub reporter for a local newspaper, I was tasked with profiling women in politics in the run up to the 2013 elections.

Other than her striking beauty and bubbly personality, Passaris struck me as a strong woman, perhaps visionary and quite forward-thinking. She did not win the 2013 poll, but in 2017, Nairobians overwhelmingly elected her as their woman rep.

Today, I wonder if Passaris knew what was ahead of her—and if at all she was prepared for the bumpy ride that is Kenyan politics—and most importantly, if it was worth it.

NOT HER HUSBAND

I say this because no woman in Kenyan politics right now has been maligned, embarrassed, shamed and bullied than Passaris. Most recently, on Madaraka Day, she was insulted by Nairobi governor Mike Sonko who told her—in public—that he is not obligated to pick her calls because he is not her husband.

Days later, alleged phone calls and conversations between Passaris and Sonko surfaced online after which the governor accused Passaris of corruption in a television show which she was not invited to respond to the allegations.

Two years ago, Passaris was called a ‘socialite bimbo’ on live television by a male politician who outrightly told her she had nothing to bring to the table other than ‘beauty’.

An old photograph of Passaris in a beautiful, see-through black dress—in which her legs are seen—has been used to shame and embarrass her. Passaris has been branded by her male opponents as an amoral, money-loving and corrupt woman who uses her looks to get ahead.

I know I speak for many people when I ask loudly how and where in the world Passaris summons the strength and energy to wake up daily and show up for work.

But Passaris is not alone.

TO HELL AND BACK

Wajir woman rep Fatuma Gedi has been to hell and back. Two days ago, Gedi was minding her own business in Parliament when a male MP, the ‘honorable member’ for Wajir East Rashid Amin, confronted her over a budget issue and even before she could explain herself, Amin punched her in the face.

Last year, many of you might not know this, Gedi was a victim of fake news and online bullying when she was accused of being the woman in a viral sexual video that was published in some swampy parts of the Internet. Just to be clear, the woman in the video is not Gedi and, secondly, the video was published online in 2016.

Being a female politician in this country is hell, literally. The way we treat our female leaders reflects what a rotten and backward society we are.

Our female leaders have become our societal punching bag; we insult them unprovoked, we plant malicious stories about them in newspapers and blogs, we slut-shame them, photoshop their pictures in compromising and dirty photos, doubt their capabilities and on top of that, hold them to a higher standard than we do their male counterparts.

When a woman gets into politics, the first thing we want to know is who her husband is and who is funding her campaigns, besides the lingering accusation that she must have properly ‘lobbied’ to get the party nomination.

FLOWER GIRLS

We do not see our female leaders as intellectuals, but as flower girls to be objectified and harassed. She will be damned if she is a looker because we will accuse her of being a ‘slay queen’ and also damned if she is not much of a looker because we will accuse her of behaving (and looking) like a man.

But the most disgusting aspect of our society is how we have normalised violence against female leaders and incubated this brazen male impunity in which we allow men like Mike Sonko, Miguna Miguna, Evans Kidero and Rashid Amin to get away with assaulting our women leaders.

The blatant hypocrisy with which we approach violence against female leaders is outstanding; that we condemn and bring to book men who mete out violence on their wives, yet not even lift a finger when Amin assaults Fatuma Gedi.

Granted, female politicians are not angels. Some are as corrupt and incapable as their male counterparts, neither am I advocating for special treatment.

Road encroachment that has become Kasarani residents’ worst nightmare – VIDEO,[],"We told you the story of a five-year-old boy was hit and left for dead by a boda boda rider in Kasarani on the evening of August 26, 2019.

The scene of the accident was along Mradi road, in Kasarani.

KNOCKED DOWN

On that fateful evening, Baby Nathan stood next to his mother as they waited for Mama Mboga to prepare their vegetable.

Minutes later, the little boy was lying on the ground having been knocked down by a boda boda rider who had two pillions.

After the incident, the boda boda rider and his two passengers took off leaving, the injured boy in a pool of blood.

At that time, Mama Nathan was in a state of shock thinking her son was dead.

That is the story of many more parents around Kasarani area.

NIGHTMARE

Nairobi News visited the scene of the accident and witnessed first-hand how road encroachment by traders has become nightmare to many area residents.

Walking along Mradi road and other roads within Kasarani that lead to estates and residential homes is very dangerous, especially for school going children.

Accidents, like that of Baby Nathan, have become common, with the residents blaming it on hawkers who have encroached on the roads.

Pedestrians have no choice but to walk on the roads because the hawkers have erected business structures next to the road blocking off the footpath.

Mornings and evenings have turned out to be nightmares for parents as they have to accompany their children to and from schools.

ENCROACHMENT

The residents have on many occasions asked the ward administrators to look into the matter, but months later nothing has been done.

According to the Nairobi County roads CEC Hitan Majevdia his office is aware of the road encroachment by traders in Kasarani.

“The complaint has reached our office but I have not yet visited the site. I’m planning to visit next week or the week after. But remember my department does not remove hawkers that is done by reinforcement and security guys. The team is already aware because even KeNHA has complained,” Majevdia told Nairobi News.

As we wait for the county government of Nairobi to act, there is a high risk that many more children, like Baby Nathan, may end up injured or killed in similar accidents in this area.

Mombasa and Outering Roads continue to lead in road fatalities in Nairobi,[],"Mombasa and Outering Roads continue to lead in the number of road fatalities in Nairobi even as the capital leads in the number of deaths countrywide.

According to the latest report from National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA), Nairobi recorded 275 deaths between January 1 and August 19, 2019.

BLACK SPOTS

Out of this, Mombasa Road accounted for 27 deaths, Outering Road 23 followed by Waiyaki Way and Thika Super Highway both at 18, Kangundo Road with 16, Jogoo Road and Eastern Bypass with 12 and Juja Road with 10 deaths.

Other major roads in the capital recorded less than 10 deaths during the period under review with Northern bypass, Nairobi-Malindi, Mwiki-Kasarani, Lang’ata and Enterprise Roads with three deaths.

Murang’a Road, Southern bypass, Ngong and Forest Roads recorded four deaths while Kiambu Road had five, Northern bypass six and North Airport Road recording nine fatalities.

Last year, 273 black spots across the country were identified by NTSA, 199 of them being in the Northern Corridor and 74 in Nairobi alone.

Private vehicles lead in causing the deaths with 73 involved in the crashes so far.

This is followed by unknown vehicles at 64, Public Service Vehicles (PSVs) at 56, commercial vehicles 42, motor cycles 33, government vehicles at 2, the same as pedal cycles while only a single tuk tuk and handcart have been involved in any fatalities since January.

PEDESTRIAN FATALITIES

Out of the 274 fatalities recorded in Nairobi, pedestrians continued to lead the way recording 163 deaths followed by motorcyclists at 48, passengers 34, drivers at 15, pillion (motorcycle) passengers at 11 and lastly pedal cyclists with only three recorded deaths.

Other counties with high numbers of road fatalities include Kiambu with 183 deaths, Machakos 141, Nakuru 134 and Makueni 87, Murang’a 82, Kericho 74 and Nyeri 72.

At the bottom of the list is Embu County with 39 road fatalities, Narok and Siaya both with 42, Kitui at 45, Nyandarua with 46 road crashes and Kisii and Kilifi with 48.

Only Kisumu, Narok, Kilifi and Nyandarua recorded less deaths in the period compared to a similar one last year.

Nationally, 2,181 deaths have been recorded so far representing an increase of 276 compared to the same period last year.

Pedestrians continue to be majority of the fatalities with 839 which is an increase compared to 727 recorded during the same period last year.

The same increase was posted by motorcyclists which was from 515 during the same period last year to 641.

PASSENGERS’ DEATH TOLL

A total of 450 passengers have lost their lives on Kenyan roads across the country, an increase from last year’s 433; 204 drivers from 193 last year and 47 pedal cyclists from 37 in the same period last year.

Motorcyclists’ deaths recorded the biggest increase of 126 despite government’s efforts to streamline the sector after concerns were raised by accidents involving boda boda operators.

The then NTSA director for Road Safety Njeri Waithaka said in February that the authority had developed regulations to guide the sector which among other things will make it an offense to carry more than one pillion passenger, headlights to be on at all times and the operators to join associations in order to help in streamlining their operations.

Further, the report states that private vehicles, commercial vehicles and motor cycles lead in the type of means of transport involved in crashes in the country.

Privately owned vehicles lead with 575 fatalities since January, commercial followed with 504 and motorcycle with 439.

The report further highlighted that a total of 346 Public Service Vehicles (PSVs) have been involved in accidents so far, 286 unknown vehicles, 14 government vehicles, five tuk tuks, four handcarts and two pedal cycles.",https://nairobinews.nation.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/DNOUTERRING0112a.jpg,[],https://nairobinews.nation.co.ke/campaigns/mombasa-and-outering-roads-continue-to-lead-in-road-fatalities-in-nairobi,2019-08-28 09:27:50

“There is no point of boda bodas parking in the CBD yet there are no customers. They will now drop passengers and then go back to the shades because at the moment our askaris are after them whenever they access the CBD,” he said.

City Hall banned boda boda operators from accessing the city centre in March 2018. Over 4, 000 motorbikes have been impounded by the county government in crackdown on non-compliant operators.

He said that some of the six locations where the shades will be erected are Landi Mawe, Railways, Globe Cinema Roundabout and Kariokor.

Each shade will hold between 20 and 80 riders.

The county executive said that the shades will have a place to sit, space for the riders to put their helmets and vests and allow them also to have water dispenser.

CARPETED WITH CABROS

“The shades will be built at a workshop and then brought to the locations. The floors will be carpeted using cabros. We are planning to fix all of them in a single day,” he said.

Mr Majevdia said that City Hall engineers are in the process of coming up with designated sketch on which roads boda bodas can use within the CBD.

“We will officially announce which streets they can use once the sketch is ready. We will give it to their association which will in turn give it to them,” he said.

“We are trying to let them to regulate themselves and if they are not then we will come in. What happens now is that they are split into many places fighting for the same passengers but this will give them the chance to self-regulate and streamline the sector,” said Mr Majevdia.",https://nairobinews.nation.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Boda-boda-Nairobi-II-1200x630.jpg,[],https://nairobinews.nation.co.ke/campaigns/state-of-roads/sonko-approves-six-boda-boda-termini-in-congested-city-centre,2019-08-06 17:00:10

Once-dilapidated Pumzi Lane gets breath of fresh air – PHOTOS,[],"Pumzi Lane, which stretches from Mondlane Street to Khoja Junction, has for long been in a deplorable state.

And the situation had only been made worse some time last year during the long heavy rains.

In its previous state, the road was piratically unusable by motorists and pedestrians.

At one point, the road had been reduced to a potholes-riddled stretch of garbage, mud and raw sewage.

Predictably, street urchins and the city’s homeless folks capitalized on the situation to colonize the street.

REHABILITATION

Thankfully, the situation has now changed for the better.

But it took relentless pressure from the public and many stories about the road in the media, for the Nairobi City County Government to comply and rehabilitate the street, through financing from the Road Maintenance Levy Fund.

The project, which began on September 28, 2018, is in its final stages of completion.

The road has already been fully tarmacked from end to end, with pedestrian walkways on either side of the road to allow city residents to maneuver with ease.

ZEBRA CROSSING

The many buildings along the street, whose backdoor entrances, loading zones and access to basement parking had for fallen into disuse, will soon happily open them up for use.

Impressively, the adjoining Nuru Lane, Moi Lane and other lanes which allow residents to move in-between buildings have all had cabro laid down on them for easy access. There is even a zebra crossing for pedestrians.

The final stretch at the Khoja Junction is due for completion with the street now being a one-way access as one lane has been reserved for parking.

Lamu Senator in fresh scandal of ‘using’ and dumping woman he met online – VIDEO,[],"Lamu Senator Anwar Loitiptip is facing a fresh scandal following claims by a 36-year-old woman that he impregnated then ditched her.

The woman by the name Hanifa Were on Sunday publicly came out with the claims of how she met the youthful senator through Facebook way back in April.

FIRST DATE

While addressing journalists at the Muslims for Human Rights offices, Hanifa gave a blow-by-blow account of her short-lived clandestine affair with the senator.

But in his response, the controversial 33-year-old senator, who is married, dismissed the claims as a calculated ploy to tarnish his name.

The senator however admits knowing the woman, but claims that a week into the relationship he realized it was not going to work.

“After knowing her for a week, nilidhani kama kuna weza kuwa a relationship ambayo inaweza prosper but mataranjio ya binadamu ni tofauti. Nikakuta we cannot have anything together,” Senator Anwar told the media.

His account sharply contradicts that of the woman who even claims the senator has been trying to silence her with threats of dire consequences should she ‘spoil his image’.

“He inboxed me through Messenger after seeing my Facebook page. At first he told me he had a business idea he wanted to share with me but things changed later when we met,” said Hanifa, who is a mother of a 15-year-old daughter.

WENT SILENT

According to Hanifa, she met the senator in Nairobi after two days of chatting online.

The woman claims they stayed at the senator’s house in Nairobi for two days before the senator said he needed to go to Kisumu on a work-related trip.

She claims the senator overstayed in Kisumu and she decided to leave for Mombasa for her sister’s place.

She alleges that the senator booked a flight for her, but that was the last she heard of him because he completely went silent on her.

“I went to my sister’s place, I never heard from Anwar again. After three weeks, I started feeling unwell and when I took a pregnancy test, I found out I was pregnant,” she said.

For the few days she was with the senator the woman claims she felt loved and thought maybe she had finally found someone who loved her.

THREATS

She says after the senator issued the threats she reported the matter at Kadzandani Police Post and recorded statements at the Dog Section and Nyali police station.

But according to Senator Anwar, who also claims he has recorded statements with the police, he never sent any goons to trail the woman.

“Nina changamoto mingi sana ya kisiasa, ningekuwa na moyo wakulipiza watu ambao wamenikosea maisha yangu nadhani ningekuwa nimemaliza watu wengi sana,” he said.

This is the latest scandal that has hit the flamboyant senator.

In early June, the senator was admitted at a Nairobi hospital for a few days after being assaulted and injured by unknown attackers at a city nightclub.

GREAT PAIN

“I miss gyming, I have not been able to exercise. I can’t walk for more than half an hour. I can’t sleep at night and that’s why I look exhausted. Even with the painkillers, I can’t sleep,” she stated.

“Yesterday I was in church and every time we had to stand for a song, I was in pain. I chose to stand because people wouldn’t understand why I am sitting,” she said.

This is the second time this year that the Nairobi Woman Rep is being admitted in hospital to undergo surgery.

Rachel Ruto met Akothee and this is what she had to say about her,[],"If you thought you have seen enough of popular musician Esther Akoth, famously known as Akothee, you are in for a big shock as the siren has captured the attention of Second Lady, Rachel Ruto, with her big heart and philanthropic activities in Turkana.

The mother of five held talks with the wife of Deputy President’s William Ruto on Friday who was left awestruck by her initiatives to give back to the less fortunate.

Mrs Ruto took to her social media pages to express her joy at having met the flamboyant businesswoman.

“It was really nice spending time with Esther Akoth ( Akothee) today! What a beautiful story of determination and drive. We thank God for the work Akothee foundation is doing especially in Turkana! Esther has great tenacity & a beautiful spirit! We wish you all the best!” wrote Rachel on Twitter.

The controversial singer also turned to her social media to thank Mrs Ruto for the invite and opportunity to present her projects while at the same time warning her detractors that they had not yet seen the best of her.

“Thank you for the invite Mama. When I finished presenting my Turkana Project to Mama Rachel of building cultural center, schools, dormitory for old people, water project, irrigation, hospitals then she added ‘and a church in each and every center. This touched my heart deep mom! Yes a church mum we all need God,” gushed Akothee.

“For the rest who see every negative thing on every good course you will soon take back your insults. You will insult me, you will create enmity between me and innocent people. You will try to break me and sabotage everything that I do. But you know what, you can’t stop a determined anointed woman.”

She urged her critics to join hands with her in helping the needy in the society instead of bashing her.

“Charity is a call, it’s not something you learn In school and I can’t do it alone. We are all responsible to our neighbors. Do it in your own small way and get Gods rewards,” she said.

More joy for ‘Mtu wa Census’ as university clears his outstanding fees,[],"The outstanding university fees for the census enumerator who was captured on video playing with children during the census exercise in August has been cleared.

Collins Kiprono made headlines after his famous ‘watu wa census’ video went viral on social media.

In an interview with Nairobi News, Kiprono shared his struggles in life, despite his jovial and playful nature.

Kiprono, a former street kid, was meant to graduate last year in December with a Bachelor of Science in Geography from Egerton University, but he was unable to do so due to an outstanding fees balance.

Finally Kiprono can receive his much-awaited degree certificate after Egerton University Chancellor, Dr Narendra Raval, cleared the understanding fees balance of Sh 58,877.

“I can only say asante to everyone who made this possible. Now I can official graduate and start looking for employment,” said Kiprono.

Kiprono will now graduate in late November.

CASUAL WORKER

Before the census job, Kiprono was working as a casual worker in Kericho County.

At the time Nairobi News spoke to Kiprono, the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) had asked netizen to share information of Kiprono so that could ‘celebrate’ him.

Kiprono had told Nairobi News that the team from KNBS had gotten in touch with him.

We have now learnt that since their communications about two weeks ago, the KNBS have not communicated again on the way forward.

During their initial conversation, KNBS wanted Kiprono to work with them on a short project of creating short thank you video to thank Kenyans but that has not happened nor did anyone communicate to him.

Kiprono’s focus has now shifted to searching for a decent job, so he can take care of his ailing mother.",https://nairobinews.nation.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Collins-Kiprono-III.jpg,[],https://nairobinews.nation.co.ke/featured/more-joy-for-mtu-wa-census-as-university-clears-his-outstanding-fees,2019-09-10 09:04:16

Kabla ya kwenda bali katika ufafanuzi zaidi kuhusu saratani hii, kwanaza kabisa tufahamu kuhusu vifuko hivyo.

Mwanamke wa kawaida ana vifuko viwili vidogo vilivyo kila upande wa mfuko wake wa uzazi na vifuko hivyo ndivyo chimbuko la aina hii ya kansa. Lakini kwa mujibu wa tafiti, ni vigumu kuitambua.

Habari Nyingine: Mbunge wa Kibra Ken Okoth alilazwa ICU baada ya hali yake kuzorota

Anayepata dalili za saratani hii ambazo huonekana ugonjwa ukiwa umeenea mno, ni muhimu kutembelea daktari kila mwaka kwa uchukuzi wa kina.

Saratani hii haibagui ila kuna walio kwenye hatari zaidi ya kuipata na ni wafuatao:

v. Ikiwa umewahi kuwa na saratani ya matiti

iv. Wanawake wenye zaidi ya umri wa miaka 50 wako katika hatarini ya kuapata ugonjwa huu.

iii. Mwanamke tasa

ii. Msichana anayepata hedhi katika umri mdogo

i. Ikiwa kuna mtu wa familia ambaye amewahi kuugua ugonjwa huu

Vilevile serikali kupitia kwa Wizara ya Afya ina jukumu la kuhakikisha inaweka kampeini za kudumu katika kuukabili au kuangamiza ugonjwa wa saratani nchini.

Kibra by-election: ODM ward reps from Nairobi endorse Musalia Mudavadi's candidate ▷ Kenya News,['Wangeci Nderitu'],"- Nairobi MCAs have thrown their weight behind Eliud Owalo of ANC party in upcoming Kibra by-elections

The city lawmakers led by Kileleshwa MCA Elias Otieno claimed Raila colluded with Imran to cremate the latter's late brother and former Kibra MP Ken Okoth's body against family's wish.

""We the ODM MCAs from Nairobi have decided to support Eliud Owalo because the other one can't be a leader since he took away our son's body,"" said Otieno.

Owalo ditched Raila who he served as a political aide shortly before decamping to Musalia Mudavadi's ANC party.

"Adults can now be awarded degrees based on their life, work experiences",['Muyela Roberto'],"Julius Owele is a married, hardworking man with four children; in pursuit of his family’s needs, Owele works for eight hours daily at an industrial plant located at the outskirts of Nairobi as a clerk.

It is interesting to note that despite working with pledged allegiance for nine years in the plant, Owele has never risen past the clerical echelon.

Year in year out, other workers employed after him get promotions while he still waits for his recognition.

According to his employer, Owele’s plight lies in his level of education, low grades and thus lack of “proper certificates”.

This hardworking man is not oblivious of this fact; he knows he has to go back to school if he is to gain more insight in regards to his career and consequently get a promotion. However, there are many impediments to his wishes.

His many attempts to join universities in Kenya are met with “your grades are low” and therefore we cannot admit you.

He has tried but only managed to get a university in USA which required that he travels to US. This presented another tough problem since he cannot leave his family behind and his employer will not allow this.

Julius is left with the option of joining young and fresh high school graduates who are the age of his first born.

This option from a local university would make him sit in class with children the age of his own and struggle with bridging Mathematics which he knows he can never pass.

The more distressing fact is that Owele is not alone in his dilemma. His story is just a reflection of thousands of adults who want to go back to school but are deterred by policies and norms of the present educational systems around Africa.

This was the case of James Osore who had managed grade C- in O level examinations in Kenya and could not access university education since the minimum grade for university admission is C+.

Osore is a gifted man who has struggled from being a herdsman, messenger, supervisor in a clearing and forwarding company owned by his boss.

When the boss retired to Yemen, he was left part of the company with “other experts” who had bought shares in the company.

The boss had no children to inherit and so gave part of the shares to the loyal Osore who had been with him for 18 years!

The experts were only interested in sharing out the proceeds of the company and within eight months, they had shared the company and left Osore with only his share.

Convinced he could revive the company, Osore worked hard, from his life and work experiences with the boss and turned the company to be one of the biggest in East Africa.

He has employed several graduates and manages the company as the CEO. However, he wishes to get recognition and climb the academic ladder by obtaining a bachelors degree.

That is when he also realized that his grade cannot allow him to access degree level programmes.

Desperate for a university degree, Osore used a typewriter to change the C- to C+ and sought admission to a public university.

After two semesters, and having passed well, someone discovered that he had faked his grades. Of course, he was rudely kicked out of the university.

You must have heard it, adults beyond 70 years of age have been yearning to have education.

In Kenya for example, a 75-year old hit the world news for joining Primary School with his great grand children.

He was made to wear school uniform and sit with the children. He struggled for 4 years before passing on.

Maybe he encouraged the young ones and gained international fame, but did he meet his objectives? Did he have to undergo this as an adult seeking education?

The big question therefore is: Is there hope for those adults with vast work experience, in need for a second chance in education or will their dreams be forever sacrificed at the altar of rigid educational policies and structures?

This is where Adult Experiential Learning comes in.

Adults do need a means of study that befits their age, obligations, ambitions and in environments that understand them.

Experiential learning is often thought of as a learning cycle with experience and reflection being the first two phases.

The idea of experiential learning as a cycle was suggested by prominent educationalists such as Jean Piaget, John Dewey and David Kolb.

It is their work that gave birth to the World Council for Adult Learning with headquarters in USA over the last 46 years.

The African branch i.e African Council for Adult Experiential Learning (ACAEL) was launched in 2007.

It is this council that has scientific and professional tools that are used to evaluate and assign “Credit Values” to Life Achievement and Work Experience.

The process known as MATRIC uses special tools known as “bio-psycho-matrics” and a select set of experts across the world who carry out the process.

It is a process that undertakes “Mature Talent Evaluation”, “Credit Matriculation”, and “Accreditation Process” which finally extracts “Credit Values”.

A report is then produced followed by a “Learning Prescription” that now matches usual course units in the form of Credit Points.

The prescription further indicates the right course, level, modules to be exempted, additional modules and support programmes needed to fill skills gaps and build intellectual demand (if necessary) and the universities or colleges that would accept the credits.

A number of international universes are members of the council and their courses easily get assigned these credit values hence credit points.

The important of it all is that the adult becomes eligible to join a university course without the usual grades threshold from traditional examinations.

The process , which lasts about 45 minutes has helped many people in the world who were initially locked out of higher education due to the rigid policies and outright arrogance in colleges and universities.

It comes as a big relief for adults who have been subjected to humiliation by our educationists that merely seek to find your memory power even if you are an old man and naturally unable to memorise.

Prof. Humphrey Oborah ( and who is also World Secretary General of Talent), summarizes the predicament of these adults thus:

“ It beats logic that we send our students for course attachment to companies or organisations built and run by drop outs. The drop outs sign reports of competence for our students and when they wish to join our universities, we remind them of grades required for admission. That is when the logic and meaning of education becomes stupid”.

Oborah is also President of African Federation for Gifted and Talented.

"Betting firm empowering youths, changing game",['Rene Otinga'],"Betika is definitely changing the betting landscape in the country in more ways than one.

Not only is the platform investing in the youth, but it also offers gamers a chance to reap major winnings from the newly introduced KSh 100 million jackpot.

Through facilitating venues and providing kits and prize money, they have shown some great intent in furthering the beautiful game in the country. Photo: Betika

As is the norm with most betting sites, such a hefty jackpot requires one to stake at least KSh 100, leaving anyone with less than the stake with no chance.

With Betika however, gamers with an eye for the 17-game jackpot can bet with as little as KSh 49, with guaranteed bonuses on at least 12 accurate predictions.

Away from that, Betika is also a proud sponsor of Kenya Premier League side Sofapaka.

There is also hope for local talent on ground level as Betika has sponsored and held local football tournaments which have gone some way in identifying skilled young players.

Through facilitating venues and providing kits and prize money, they have shown some great intent in furthering the beautiful game in the country.

Among these tournaments are the Score Kenya tournament in Kibra, the Kriss Darling Cup in Kibra, kitting Bongonaya FC, the inter-estates tournament in Nakuru and many more.

Football is not the only forte they have invested in, as they are also keen on supporting kids with talents in different fields.

In the buildup to the score tournament in Kibra, for example, Betika met Kevin Agure, a local comedian.

Kevin had created a dummy cheque and all he was asking for from Betika was KSh 500.

As a show of goodwill, Betika gave him a cheque of KSh 50,000, which was expected to be used to enhance his life.

Agure has since started a small business and against the odds, he is able to cater for his most basic needs.

The past three weekends saw the first edition of the inter-estates tournament in Nakuru and Betika was on hand to kit the teams.

Betika is looking forward to doing more of these tournaments in the grassroots and meeting the local youths in their localities.

They believe this is the best way to support and help them nurture talent and get into the professional world of sports.

- Judgement has been issued and the court held the school violated the rights of the student

The High Court has declared that Rastafarianism is a religion in a case in which a parent sued Olympic High School for kicking daughter out of school after she refused to shave her dreadlocks during Form One admission.

In his ruling, Justice Chacha Mwita held that the decision by the school to keep the minor out of school due to her religion was an infringement and violation of the Constitution.

""Rastafarian is a religion and must be accorded it's respect as any other religion...The right to basic education by every child is protected by the Constitution and every parent has a legal responsibility to take their children to school,"" Justice Mwita ruled.

He noted the Constitution guaranteed every person a right to religious faith and cutting the minor's hair was contrary to her religion.

""No person should be compelled contrary to their religion, a declaration is issued that the decision of Olympic school keeping the minor out of school due to her dreadlocks was unconstitutional, null and void,"" he said.

The court further directed the school administration to immediately call the student back to the institution.

Mwita issued a permanent injunction against the school from interfering with the minor's right to education.

The judge in addition ordered that school rules must not be applied in a manner that infringes on rights contemplated in the constitution.

The minor's father, moved to court on January 14, 2019, and sued the school’s board of governors for sending home her daughter when she reported.

The court issued orders on Tuesday, January 29, directing the school to admit the student pending hearing and determination of the matter.

Through his lawyer, Shadrack Wambui told the court that the minor went through primary education without shaving her hair.

The father, while testifying in court, stated that the girl was in class when she was summoned by the deputy head teacher who sent her away ordering that she only returns to school after shaving her dreadlocks.

He added that all their family members are Rastafarians and that they are forbidden by the Bible from cutting their hair.

The father further quoted Numbers and Leviticus in the Bible as the reason he has never shaved her hair.

Rare coloured young Zebra spotted in Maasai Mara,['Rene Otinga'],"Visitors to the Mara were left in awe after coming across one of the most unique sightings in nature in the form of a rare-coloured young Zebra.

Zebras are typified by their black and white strips but for this particular one, it had all the makings of a unique animal.

The amazing herbivore was first spotted at the Maasai Mara Reserve by a guide who took photos that instantly went viral.

A quick look at the zebra will reveal why many netizens took interest in the animal as it had unique spots rather than the typical stripes.

Antony Tira, the renowned guide who made the discovery revealed that because of the unique design of the young zebra, he initially thought it was deliberately painted with the spots for purposes of migration.

“At first I thought it was a zebra that had been captured and painted or marked for purposes of migration. I was confused when I first saw it,"" he told Nation.

The Zebra, which apparently has a rare melanin disorder, was barely a week old at the time it was spotted by the guide.

Because of the “additional wonder” at the Maasai Mara reserve, hundreds of tourists found themselves wanting to get a glimpse, and perhaps a photo of the rare animal.

Wildlife specialist at Matira Camp Parmale Lemein noted this was probably the very first case in the Mara.

So what is the fate of the special zebra?

According to the experts, animals with albinism can live up to six months, sometimes even more.

Known to few, Zebras are technically not black and white animals and the stripes are simply an adaptation of nature.

The default colour of a zebra is black but the white stripes are formed from the inhibition of melanin.

It is an adaptation of nature which scientists believe is meant to keep insects at bay as the monochrome pattern seems to throw off the visual systems of flies.

Romelu Lukaku has got an Italian commentator Luciano Passirani sacked on his behalf after the journalist made racist remarks about the Inter Milan forward.

The former Manchester United striker was a guest in a talk show called TopCalcio24 hosted by Passirani.

He said: ""I don't see in the Italian league a player like Lukaku in any team, not in AC Milan, Inter, Rome, Lazio.

""He's one of the strongest and I like him a lot because he's one of the strongest, he's at least twice as strong as (Duvan) Zapata from Atalanta.

""These players have something more than the others, these are the guys who make the goals and drag the team.

""If they go one-on-one with you you're dead, you fall to the ground. The only way to out-muscle him is to give him ten bananas to eat.""

Passiriani tried to play down the joke and quickly apologized he did not intend to be racist.

But he was immediately kicked out after TV channel director Fabio Ravezzani appeared on-air to immediately issue an apology to Lukaku and confirmed Parssirani would never appear on the network again.

Luakku later tweeted: ""Only a fraction of the transmission was spread widely, cutting off the guest's subsequent apology that he had a moment of unpredictable confusion thinking of making a joke.

Lukaku was racially abused during Inter Milan's 2-1 away win at Cagliari as fans made monkey chants at the striker when he stepped up to take a penalty.

Lukaku wrote: ""Many players in the last month have suffered from racial abuse. I did yesterday too.

""Football is a game to be enjoyed by everyone and we shouldn't accept any form of discrimination that will put our game in shame.

""I hope the football federations all over the world react strongly on all cases of discrimination!

""Social media platforms ( Instagram , Twitter , Facebook ) need to work better as well with football clubs because every day you see at least a racist comment under a post of a person of colour.

""We've been saying it for years and still no action.

""Ladies and gentlemen it's 2019. Instead of going forward we're going backwards and I think as players we need [to] unify and make a statement on this matter to keep this game clean and enjoyable for everyone.""

- The region has for long been predominantly Opposition stronghold with ODM enjoying huge support

Deputy President William Ruto on Sunday, September 15, launched a multi-million electrification project aimed at connecting rural households to the power grid.

The DP who was touring coast region commissioned phase two of the KSh 1.2 billion Taita Taveta Last Mile project in Buguta village, Taita Taveta county, and brought electricity to the families of Mzee Kimega Mabodza Ng'anda and Crispus Ng'anda.

Ruto's recent return to the coast region, a predominantly Opposition stronghold, is seen as yet another attempt to forge new alliances, gain a foothold in the vote rich bloc and politically unsettle the ODM party which is Jubilee Party's biggest rival in this region.

The DP nevertheless denied claims his frequent tours across the country has anything to do with the 2022 succession politics.

""They keep on saying the deputy president is always moving around the country. They have constantly accused me of trying to shift the political ground in my favour. However, what they should know is that I am here in the capacity of deputy president. I am at work, this is the work of deputy president. I was not elected to just sit in the office, let them not plug politics in matters development,"" he said on Sunday.

Baringo senator Gideon Moi has urged leaders to shelve 2022 politics and throw their weight behind President Uhuru Kenyatta.

This, Gideon said, will help the country move forward in unison besides helping the president achieve his ambitious Big Four agenda.

According to Gideon, it was only God who knows what direction the country will take in 2022, adding that it was important for those aspiring to exercise patience.

""2022 politics is by the grace of God. When Uhuru's term comes to an end, then those who are interested will get into the race. But until then, let us work,"" the senator said.

Even as McDonald Mariga waits to know whether or not IEBC will allow him to vie in the Kibra by-election, his troubles seem to be far from over.

The DCI is also probing legality of his registration documents.

Among issues the DCI is set to probe are whether or not the Jubilee Party flag-bearer's identity card and KCSE exam certificate are genuine.

Sleuths also seek to know if the EACC is aware of the above concerns and if it issued the aspirant with a compliance certificate to enable him participate in the Kibra race.

The contested documents indicate Mariga was enrolled in class one at age three and he sat for KCSE exams while at the age of 15. Critics say this is impossible.

Concern has emerged on whether or not DP William Ruto continues to enjoy political support from coast based leaders after most of them failed to show up during his five days visit to the region.

Previously, when Ruto trooped to the Coast, he could be accompanied by a team of up to 20 MPs but his last week's tour was largely snubbed.

Among leaders who were no show at some of the DP's functions are governors Salim Mvurya (Kwale), Amason Kingi (Kilifi), Granton Samboja (Taita Taveta) and Dhado Godhana.

During his tour in Tana River county on Thursday last week, only Bura MP Ali Wario attended.

Experts attribute the leaders' absence (especially those allied to ODM) to woes that befell Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa and her Msambweni counterpart Suleiman Dori.

"Angry crowd attempt to chase away Maina Kamanda, team kieleweke from Nanyuki church ▷ Kenya News",['Rene Otinga'],"- Kamanda was at the St Paul’s AIPCA Catholic Church in Nanyuki on Sunday, September 15

- He unleahsed a thin-veiled attack on DP Ruto and his affiliates by claiming no one would vote in the so-called Tangatanga faction

- There was also mild drama in the area as DP supporters wanted to chase Kamanda from the area

A case of nasty politics played out on a Sunday once again after nominated MP Maina Kamanda was chased away from theSt Paul’s AIPCA Catholic Church in Nanyuki.

Kamanda, an affiliate of the Kieleweke faction was dismissed by an irate crowd as he made his way to the church.

A video accessed by TUKO.co.ke on Sunday, September 15, revealed the tens of protesters bearing placards as they protested the 68-year old’s presence.

One placard conspicuously read , ""Maina stop fighting your grand children""

Despite the heavy jeering, Kamanda still got the chance to address congregants where he hit out at leaders allied to Ruto.

The MP sensationally reiterated they would not vote in the Tangatanga block ""even at gun point"" as he called on leaders to allow President Uhuru Kenyatta ample time to deliver on the Big Four agenda.

“We will not be forced to give you votes even at gun point. We also have our leaders as it is in other tribes. Our leader, Uhuru, will give us direction when the time comes,” he said.

It marked another weekend of trouble for Kamanda, who does not seem too popular in the Mount Kenya region at the moment.

Barely a week ago, the MP faced off with his much younger counterpart – Kiharu lawmaker Ndindi Nyoro during a fundraiser in Murang’a.

Nyoro, a popular figure in the area, wanted to be the one to coordinate the event and his supporters made his feelings known through a physical altercation with Kamanda’s brigade.

The Murang’a fracus had a ripple effect on Nyoro, who has publicly accused leaders who are against Deputy President William Ruto of targeting him.

While addressing the media on Tuesday, Nyoro blatantly claimed Kamanda phoned him hours before the Murang’a fundraiser to warn him for supporting Ruto’s so-called Tangatanga faction.

How are ethics and supply-chain management related?,['Gladys Mokeira Obiero'],"Are you an owner or member of any organization, either big or small that conducts business? Does the organization care about the wellbeing of consumers? If the answer is yes to any of the questions, then you ought to understand how ethics and supply-chain management are related for maximum utility of your company goods or services.

Remember that, for every service or utility provided, there needs to be proper and satisfying distribution chain for everyone to have a happy face at the end of a transaction. Here is how ethics and supply chain management are related to the success of a business.

Definition of ethics and supply chain management

Ethics is the accepted code of conduct in any transaction between two or more people. A supply chain is a path followed in the distribution of a product or service to reach the final customer. It means there are a series of costs to be incurred on various levels or departments of the supply chain for the product to reach a customer.

So, what is supply-chain ethics? It is a reliable and responsible customer service experience. More descriptions are available depending on the path that an organization has decided to follow in maintaining its standards.

Types of ethical issues in supply chain management

Over the past years, the supply chain has become a defining part of most companies. Supply chain processes have been remodelled to include the most strategic initiatives for making a business improve both economically and socially.

Even though it is tough and next to impossible to provide an ideal and healthy supply chain, all the business parties which include the managerial officers, manufacturing staff, suppliers, retailers, and consumers, need to put the following categories of ethical behaviour into consideration.

1. High standards of professionalism

Each member of the supply chain should conduct themselves in a manner worthy of the role they have been entrusted. It includes a deserved amount of respect and avoiding advances that could interfere with others. All the laid down terms and conditions must be obligatory for all.

2. Transparency and accountability

Fairness and responsibility need to be at the forefront of every transaction and adherence to business policies.

3. Personal integrity

Personal integrity should be a driving force for every individual to make sure that the entire supply chain follows the correct policies. Receiving favours behind the back of others to gain an unfair advantage should not be a practice by any personnel as this is considered unethical.

4. Compliance and constant improvement

Progressive improvement should act as a guide to offer the best supply chain process. While purchasing the code of ethics for use in a firm is impossible, complying to the changes in the industry should also be mandatory.

Doing all the stated ethical issues in business can and will earn better ratings from the government and even from outside investors.

Unethical practises in supply chain management

Supply chain management entails making sure that a product is at most reliable state to a customer. However, lack of proper management of the supply chain is going against the accepted codes of conduct, thus rendering business unethical.

Over the years, financial advantages such as cutting costs of operations have been the driving force behind unethical corporate behaviours. It has majorly been influenced by practices that have led to companies not adhering to the code of conducts for business. They include:

1. Cutthroat business competitions

Unhealthy competitions curtail the proper flow of products from the producers as each corporation is trying to out-do their competitor.

2. Poor management

Lacking proper management is by far the main reason behind the manufacture and distribution of counterfeit goods. It has eventually affected the customer negatively but still creates an enormous amount of profits for some members at the top of the chain.

3. The desire for huge profits

As much as it may benefit all the parties in the supply chain, it still disadvantages the consumer who has to use a low-quality product at the expense of low price.

4. Lack of transparency between parties

It hinders adherence to the codes guiding supply of a product from one end to another. A company may manipulate officers or managers to gain the advantage of not following the legal channel of distribution.

5. Illegal practices

One or all of the parties in the distribution chain might opt to use cheap and unlawful labour force. It maximizes profits at the expense of ethical, social, and business requirements.

6. Unreliable business environment

Conducting business in a manner that endangers the wellbeing of others through illegal pollution or using supply chain practices that do not adhere to the healthy approaches can affect a business. For instances, failing to honour the promises given to customers, thereby forfeiting agreed deadlines.

7. Poor labour standards

Use of cheap unqualified staff that can be easily manipulated to alter the accepted tendering processes for the good of the other parties is one of the unethical supply chain examples.

Emerging issues in supply chain management

The field of supply-chain management has continuously been evolving. These changes are attributable to novel technologies, new consumer demands, pressure from e-commerce that has taken the whole business world in a storm, and education.

1. Technological advancements

In recent times, the shift and improvements in technology have become rapid hence the need for corporations to adopt new ways of integrating changes in their systems effectively. For example, the introduction of drones and automated robots will revolutionize the transportation and storage processes in a company.

2. The need to make costs dynamic

Companies should be able to establish costs dynamic based on real-time visibility. Companies that will be in a position to total all the costs of distributing goods to customers in real-time will be able to make the right initiatives to making more profits.

3. Evolution in data collection and management

With a massive amount of information on the internet, companies have been able to gain more visibility of ethics in supply chain management in real-time. This change has also endowed companies with the ability to respond to challenges reliably. The availability of enough data can be used to develop an insight into an incoming problem and ways to tackle it to make a better supply chain and business in general.

4. Changes in customer channels

Due to e-commerce, most transactions are majorly customer-producer. There is a shift from traditional channels to new distribution systems where goods can be shipped directly to the consumer.

You have seen how ethics and supply-chain management are related and how to ensure they are integrated effectively with no manipulations whatsoever. Its now time for your business to blossom.
